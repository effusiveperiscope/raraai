Mrs. Cake: It's just like baking.

Trixie: I can't.

Fluttershy: When the time comes, tank will leave and dig into the ground.

Rainbow Dash: You're gonna ambush them like you did in book four, the huravian caves.

Fluttershy: Oh, i'm sorry, I'm trying to be more assertive. Anyhow, She is going to do a sonic rainboom!

Smolder: I want to go home and check on him.

Applejack: Since we can't sell the bruised apples, We got to collect them all for the pigs to eat.

Fluttershy: any day!

Applejack: I'm guessing you've got a plan that will keep it that way.

Star Swirl: A necessary sacrifice.

Applejack: I was gonna say, it's pretty, but, yeah.

Rainbow Dash: Why would you think it was me?

Rarity: I guess i've been so busy running my shop.

Gabby: A cutie mark of my very own!

Trixie: ta da.

Fluttershy: You really didn't have to stay all day.

Twilight Sparkle: What are you all doing out here?

Rarity: Fluttershy, stop!

Fluttershy: you can't! My poor little animals' homes will get flooded if the snow melts too fast.

Twilight Sparkle: And he's, carrying something on his back.

Twilight Sparkle: Wow! that goes well with this ancient phoenix feather quill. We could write to each other!

Spike: And if the leader of the changelings and the dragon lord Get into a fight.

Starlight: I just never really felt the need to.

Rarity: completely slipped my mind until just now.

Spike: Right.

Fluttershy: Is probably the best way to do that.

Rainbow Dash: But there's no way he can possibly keep up. look at him!

Granny Smith: I've had a hankerin' for these all day!

Flam: See you next year.

Starlight: Maybe it'll be long gone And we'll find pharynx out here alone.

Applejack: I, guess i did get a little carried away watching over you.

Fluttershy: What ever happened to spike's mom?

Rainbow Dash: I have.

Rarity: oh my.

Sugar Belle: Oh, why don't we tell each other on three?

Twilight Sparkle: cadance is only the most amazing pony ever!

Pinkie Pie: Exactly.

Rainbow Dash: We're not making it snow. it must be the unicorns.

Rarity: It's not like fluttershy to disappear like this.

Rainbow Dash: I ruined your trip, and it's the last day ever to ride the wild blue yonder.

Twilight Sparkle: If you want to know the truth.

Grogar: to rid equestria, of twilight sparkle and her friends.

Granny Smith: Oh, is that all?

Big Macintosh: Nope.

Rainbow Dash: What's the matter, kid?

Fluttershy: What if there is something important in that chest?

Spike: Then you can help me.

Mrs. Cake: Oh no, of course not.

Twilight Sparkle: Couldn't help but overhear, You might want to take a breather,.

Twilight Sparkle: They can be an amazing source of strength.

Rainbow Dash: Yeah, if anything, she's gotten worse!

Spitfire: You want a chance to prove yourself huh?

Rarity: Fluttershy, are you in there?

Twilight Sparkle: I'm a bit nervous about cadance's visit.

Spike: Ogres and obliettes is a fantasy role playing adventure game.

Sweetie Belle: A place where we've faced all kinds of cutie mark problems.

Trixie: How could you say that?

Starlight: Let's see how they like spending the rest of their lives without their precious cutiemarks.

Applejack: Does anypony need a purple jewel?

Apple Bloom: So i pretty much got us completely and totally lost.

Twilight Sparkle: remind me how this happened again?

Twilight Sparkle: Why there must be at least twenty thousand books to organize!

Rarity: I just don't understand how you're able to do it.

Twilight Sparkle: Since you obviously know that hearth's warming Is about coming together.

Pinkie Pie: That was unexpected.

Spike: I will never wash this cheek again.

Rainbow Dash: It's an emergency!

Sweetie Belle: your aunts are so nice!

Applejack: C'mon now!

Fluttershy: Did I get it?

Yona: Yona like to flow and go!

Cheerilee: No you, biscuit wiscuit bear.

Applejack: Let it slip by.

Rainbow Dash: I wanted to fly with you both, and the decision was too hard!

Fluttershy: Have fun!

Quibble Pants: You too.

Pinkie Pie: Whee! next time, i'll pull you.

Applejack: Well, you should have tried harder!

AK Yearling: Don't bother.

Scootaloo: Pinkie pie, let us in.

Applejack: Uh huh?

Rarity: Thing with the stuff, you know.

Fluttershy: Applejack! can you please listen to me?

Granny Smith: What is it big mac?

Applejack: We'll hold 'em 'til you get back!

Pinkie Pie: Oh wait, back to the right.

Rainbow Dash: Are you kidding?

Smolder: Gallus!

Fluttershy: Zephyr breeze!

Twilight Sparkle: that we're ready to do what you do.

Twilight Sparkle: actually, since there's another player who has also had his teammate disqualified.

Spike: Hey! what if she got school credit for it?

Yona: friends save whole school from evil pegasus.

Twilight Sparkle: Please?

Sweetie Belle: Hearts and hooves day only comes Once a year, after all.

Sweetie Belle: We can help with those!

Spike: You asked for it, and dj scales n' tail is gonna deliver!

Rarity: You certainly would not want to do anything that would ruin twilight's very first slumber party.

Celestia: Everything is fine, mister and missus cake.

Twilight Sparkle: I made use of your special skills by enlisting everypony To help you learn!

Twilight Sparkle: Since they each represent one of the cultures Our students come from.

Applejack: I got a question too.

Spike: Aww.

Pinkie Pie: oh snowfall. it's not what the gift is that matters, it's what the gift means!

Twilight Sparkle: Uh, scratch that. However you normally make it is fine.

Applejack: Now hold on a sec. i can't give y'all a sneak peak!

Rainbow Dash: What? let me see that!

Rarity: I don't know what to say, twilight.

Pinkie Pie: spike's a ghost!

Yona: Yak best at field tripping!

Mayor Mare: Yes, we are all here to send Applejack to compete in this Year's equestria rodeo Competition in Canterlot.

Spike: we get it. starswirl's awesome.

Gallus: Then i came here and well, met all of you.

Rainbow Dash: So i thought i'd kick a hole in the clouds To keep her dry so she could dine in peace, that's all.

Applejack: It feels like we're going in circles.

Pinkie Pie: Well yeah, eavesdropping on every meeting is kinda weird.

Quibble Pants: Listen, if i pretend to believe this nonsense is real Will you call off the henchpony repertory theater over there?

Rainbow Dash: Not your dress! This! us!

Scootaloo: Neither have i, But spike told me it was awesome!

Starlight: Actually twilight, i am a little worried about meeting sunburst.

Rainbow Dash: i don't know what everypony's so upset about.

Tirek: She's, not as annoying as I, expected.

Flim: Flim flam's magical curative tonic!

Applejack: There's gotta be a better way Than givin' up all your feelings!

Twilight Sparkle: I think it is pretty clear that my visit with cadance didn't go quite the way i expected.

Rarity: oh Don't worry darling, I'll think of something, And i didn't use school funds to buy these.

Rainbow Dash: we totally just wiped the castle with that guy.

Quibble Pants: yes. what do you mean?

Thorax: Well honestly, no not really.

Applejack: Now, Apple Bloom, you can't just.

Pinkie Pie: Yay! I guessed it!

Twilight Sparkle: Is, that my dress?

Rainbow Dash: Just make sure that you'll have one ready for when we qualify for the aerial relay.

Twilight Sparkle: Then you're in luck.

Spike: Because, we felt bad for you!

Rainbow Dash: what gives!?

Mrs. Cake: Next thing I knew, I was whipping up pear upside down cake, And i got my cutie mark!

Pinkie Pie: Eventually we ran out of time So we just went with every berry any chip surprise!

Fluttershy: There's nothing fun about dragons! Scary, yes. fun, no!

Luna: I walked a day in your shoes.

Rainbow Dash: Give him the boot!

Pinkie Pie: No, party!?

Sweetie Belle: Oh! we can paint together. We can ride bikes, play chess, sing a song.

Twilight Sparkle: I mean somepony here doesn't want us talking to sugar belle.

Twilight Sparkle: And this works out perfectly, Because we have room for the one thing i want to do.

Fluttershy: Don't you worry, philomena.

Granny Smith: Now step aside, youngin'.

Pinkie Pie: Oh, okay. good.

Twilight Sparkle: This is big.

Rainbow Dash: I'm good.

Rarity: There's a guest performance by a local theater troupe the method mares.

Fluttershy: Did you know there's a whole wide world out here waiting to say hello?

Rarity: And be sure it's centered. that's critical.

Fluttershy: we tried to fix it ourselves.

Apple Bloom: She's from manehattan.

Twilight Sparkle: i didn't mean no, to you.

Rarity: Gently, please.

Twilight Sparkle: See?

Twilight Sparkle: And i couldn't predict the future either, so i only had one other choice.

Rainbow Dash: Gonna make me do this the hard way, huh?

Mrs. Cake: Oh it was.

AK Yearling: How do you know?

Granny Smith: As i'm up to recall, apple bloom used to love Settin' traps for the great seedling When she was a young'un.

Twilight Sparkle: to keep things fair the teams are randomly selected!

Rainbow Dash: what do you need?

Yona: Friends must be dreaming together!

Twilight Sparkle: That would be nice spike.

Apple Bloom: Great!

Zephyr: The truth is such a gift Like, i had to follow my bliss to see guarding is my calling.

Rainbow Dash: We have so got this. i'm gonna go sign us in.

Fluttershy: Excuse me mister greenhooves, But i think you might be over watering my petunias, again.

Fluttershy: What problem?

Apple Bloom: bunny sitting cutie mark.

Twilight Sparkle: If you want to forget it all and head home, i won't be offended.

Twilight Sparkle: Are you sure you don't want to come with us?

Sweetie Belle: The cute tastically fantastics?

Sassy Saddles: I can handle the rest.

Rarity: Pinkie tried to lighten the mood With some fun maritime games.

Spike: What do you mean?

Fluttershy: Um, zecora is counting on me.

Rainbow Dash: Uh, thanks but, I-I don't know if buddies is exactly the word I'd use.

Applejack: Which was what?

Fluttershy: the tree of harmony can't really be gone, can it?

Fluttershy: You have to ask yes or no questions, or they won't answer.

Thorax: it's like they don't want to, even though I'm the leader.

Twilight Sparkle: Do you know the name of the wonderbolts' premiere choreographer?

Sugar Belle: Eeyup.

Spike: And your bracelet makes it appear!

Big Macintosh: Nope.

Applejack: Well, it's about time.

Twilight Sparkle: I was just thinking, If you really don't like being a model, you could always quit.

Pinkie Pie: Happy seventy third wonderbolt training session!

Diamond Tiara: Ponyville, the early years!

Gabby: Whee! gonna get my cutie mark!

Applejack: Sure do! it had this super colorful bunch Of musical notes that just shimmered in the light.

Neighsay: A school for ponies to learn how to protect themselves.

Scootaloo: aw come on Rainbow Dash, They won't miss one pony, and we really want to go to the fair!

Twilight Sparkle: Yes!

Twilight Sparkle: Yes but.

Sweetie Belle: A lot!

Silverstream: That don't rely on the wet part.

Celestia: She is quite a sight, isn't she?

Sunburst: players previously disqualified for sleeping, May rejoin the game. provided they're well rested.

Rarity: There really doesn't need to be more to it.

Rarity: And then you and i are going to have a serious talk.

Applejack: Slumber one oh one, everything you.

Rarity: Streamlined style by Flair d'Mare!

Twilight Sparkle: that wasn't the only surprise.

Pinkie Pie: Then it's three hundred twenty eight.

Spike: You fly me up there, and i'll help you look out For boulders, like a second set of eyes!

Sunset Shimmer: Oh i wouldn't dream of it. I'm not a monster twilight.

Cheerilee: Discovering what makes you unique.

Luna: The changelings have returned and.

Scootaloo: It'll be fine. besides, how else could i get there?

Starlight: and maybe i should have known i wasn't exactly a perfect fit.

Granny Smith: sure, goldie and i will tell you all about the great seedling all day. while we work.

Pinkie Pie: Hope she still isn't mad.

Twilight Sparkle: Do you think it'll be a problem about lying?

Rainbow Dash: bulky.

Scootaloo: Uh, maybe we should head back and try again later.

Scootaloo: Come on crusaders.

Twilight Sparkle: The playful and friendly exchange of remarks! It's all in good fun.

Pinkie Pie: Tell me about it.

Sweetie Belle: Right, well, i sure am happy to see you, and spending the day With you does sound like a lot of fun but.

Apple Bloom: Every pony but us.

Sweetie Belle: Someday, somepony might even come to us with a problem That even we can't handle.

Pinkie Pie: Wait!

Pinkie Pie: If twilight comes home now, she'll be like, what'd you guys do? And we'll have to be like, nothing!

Spike: right. zephyr breeze.

Pinkie Pie: think, think, think!

Fluttershy: So, all we have to do is find those aggressive flash bees, And get them to give us their honey!

Spike: Rarity, you're safe!

Twilight Sparkle: The whole place organized by style.

Pinkie Pie: A spy? how did they know?

Sweetie Belle: We could be, um, creature catchers!

Rainbow Dash: Chop chop.

Cozy Glow: Where'd you get that? A daily affirmations calendar? Yeesh.

Pinkie Pie: So you're wearing a wig?

Rarity: Who knows, there could be jewels inside.

Rarity: And spending time on my friends Fills me with.

Rainbow Dash: Double time it over to ponyville, would ya?

Pinkie Pie: Ouch! oh! stop scratching me up, brambles!

Pinkie Pie: Apologize!

Rainbow Dash: we just need to see what your skills are.

Twilight Sparkle: it'll be a bit of an adjustment.

Spike: Uh, hi fellas.

Iron Will: Why don't you watch where you're going?

Sugar Belle: Uh, sure.

Twilight Sparkle: The key of unfettered entrance!

Rarity: You don't know how happy i am to hear you.

Sunburst: you know, i'd like to help. i i really would, i i just have so much, um.

Applejack: Not almost.

Fluttershy: If anypony needs to know how much she's appreciated, It's pinkie pie!

Zephyr: Oh, i almost forgot. all my stuff is out front. Wanna grab that for me, pops? thanks!

Spike: Makes sense. you don't exactly have your horn.

Rainbow Dash: What about you?

Luna: It doesn't work in the dream realm, It has to be you.

Pinkie Pie: because you gave back the pouch for my cannon.

Scootaloo: Oh, we don't have time to go into all that.

Rainbow Dash: But he's fixed the place up so much, it feels like a house.

Celestia: I love you sister.

Apple Bloom: Well, uh more or less.

Celestia: All right.

Twilight Sparkle: Listen, everypony! i've got something really important to say!

Scootaloo: I can't just go up and talk to them.

Twilight Sparkle: I'm glad you all had such a good time together.

Pinkie Pie: ok! you've got this! it's all you! ready?

Fluttershy: I just have to be more bold, like twilight says.

Pinkie Pie: Ah, you're wearing the slippers!

Spike: Come on, Twilight. You can do it.

Rainbow Dash: Bet you weren't expecting this!

Starlight: Behold!

Iron Will: Now, you try.

Rainbow Dash: Knock yourself out.

Rainbow Dash: That's okay. neither do we.

Discord: Nothing. I thought we were just saying each other's names.

Rarity: Nopony loses hair in a chunk, and look at the ends.

Rainbow Dash: The jungle it took forever to get to! this is the real deal!

Spike: I was just doing this to protect the ponies.

Sweetie Belle: Maybe he doesn't have to.

Starlight: It wasn't mine to trade, It belongs to my friend.

Rainbow Dash: You don't say. you know, quibble's pretty sporty too.

Rainbow Dash: Somepony put that picture in there as a joke.

Sweetie Belle: And it'll all be cleared up in half an hour or so.

Fluttershy: apparently a lot can change in a minute.

Rarity: gotcha!

Pinkie Pie: Well that just takes the cake. wait, no!

Pinkie Pie: That's why i have something even better!

Applejack: you can't just stick to the same old way of doing things and expect them to get better.

Fluttershy: Oh no! i've caught swamp fever!

Fluttershy: Oh no.

Sunset Shimmer: Excuse me?

Twilight Sparkle: But why us? why don't you.

Twilight Sparkle: every part of it failed? oh, now i'll never get the crown!

Rockhoof: Somnambula, you're out last hope.

Applejack: So even though it's for somethin' that don't seem valuable at all.

Flim: And with her bits, she could take over the whole strip, Hire away anypony she wants.

Discord: Oh, he's not that bad!

Celestia: Rainbow dash, that's your cue.

Rarity: Wonderful news, look!

Twilight Sparkle: Quest.

Rainbow Dash: Looks like somepony's got a dark cloud hanging over her head.

Sweetie Belle: Now we just need to keep them apart.

Rarity: This is a very long line for one of twisty pop's balloons.

Rainbow Dash: I thought so!

Sweetie Belle: Ok. i know exactly how to handle this.

Fluttershy: Oh, it's me.

Luna: well i'm, glad you enjoyed yourself.

Apple Bloom: Uh, not exactly. seems i'm gonna get to participate after all.

Twilight Sparkle: That must be why their cutie marks are all wrong!

Applejack: That there is the princess of friendship.

Applejack: I wasn't tryin' to take your traditions away, i was tryin' to share ours.

Twilight Sparkle: Huh. how'd i miss that?

Fluttershy: Furniture on the ground?

Twilight Sparkle: Never mind, It's not important.

Rainbow Dash: I know i can't go back and eat all the pies you made for me In the past, so, instead, I'm going to eat this giant one for you now.

Prince Rutherford: Ha ha! pink pony!

Twilight Sparkle: According to this book, it was established by their first queen, and became their most important tradition.

Pinkie Pie: I never did get that pony's name.

Spike: But how do we find the time stopping spell?

Big Macintosh: Ideas are all well and good But, you can't plow a field with them.

Rarity: Try these.

Spike: Twitchy tail?

Sunset Shimmer: You were showing them your magic I, I didn't know what else to do.

Spike: Oh no.

Applejack: That's amazin'! a perfect copy!

Pinkie Pie: Apples. apples. apples. apples! ooh, and oranges. And grapes! and strawberries! strawberry cupcakes!

Rainbow Dash: It han't been traded yet!

Granny Smith: Now where'd you all get to? I ain't seen you's all day.

Twilight Sparkle: What? Where is everypony?

Twilight Sparkle: Yep! we're gonna do something i want us to do, as a family.

Celestia: It is time for a new day in equestria.

Rarity: i almost forgot! the most important part of the ball!

Scootaloo: is the end of the cutie mark crusaders!

Spike: Hey, wait up! i'm an important part of this team, remember!?

Applejack: We wanted to bring you a care package.

Fluttershy: Aww, look at that. i guess you were all just cranky because  you were hungry.

Starlight: I should probably get somepony to cover my student counseling Duties while we're gone though.

Spike: You aren't feeling any molt effects are you?

Apple Bloom: quick, you have to help us!

Applejack: Well all righty then.

Ember: Are you calling me a liar?

Rainbow Dash: Get, it, off, me!

Discord: Me too.

Rainbow Dash: Can you get us some wood for the fire?

Fluttershy: And if we lose or forfeit one game, We'll be out of the tournament.

Shining Armor: Twily.

Twilight Sparkle: Comets are small, irregularly shaped bodies that are made of non-volatile grains and frozen gases.

Applejack: Why?

Maud: They're starting to grow on me.

Applejack: Mine's working. There must be something wrong with yours.

Scootaloo: But it just comes when it comes.

Starlight: I'm sure.

Applejack: No way am i leavin' my little baby sister home alone all by herself!

Scootaloo: Aw come on Rainbow Dash, They won't miss one pony, and we really want to go to the fair!

Pinkie Pie: Those yaks are so stubborn.

Rarity: Ponies might stop buying my couture!

Applejack: Dag nabbit.

Rarity: Spike! i'm so glad you're here!

Pinkie Pie: This is the best news ever!

Twilight Sparkle: You know something girls? We are so lucky to live in this town. I love you all.

Apple Bloom: Got that, diamond tiara?

Tirek: But we have no time for such things.

Rarity: They may not be as sophisticated as some of you canterlot ponies.

Applejack: They're honorary diplomas, Making y'all official graduates of this here school.

Rainbow Dash: Uh.

Granny Smith: We think you're a hoot after all.

Pinkie Pie: I think i just confused myself.

Twilight Sparkle: Why?

Pinkie Pie: And i'd seen them in Matilda's book!

Spike: Starlight, come on! we have to At least explain what twilight wants!

Rarity: You see, darling? Change can be fabulous if you embrace it!

Smolder: Greed induced bigness.

Rarity: there he is.

Scootaloo: Rainbow dash's linen closet.

Twilight Sparkle: And applejack will have slaved over those apple brownberries for nothing.

Twilight Sparkle: Pinkie's tail's a twitchin'. what else can i do?

Rainbow Dash: What are you all doing out here?

Discord: While i would love to sit around chit chatting About feeding and not feeding.

Granny Smith: I'ma go wash up for supper. Be right back.

Discord: I'll take it.

Silverstream: What?

Twilight Sparkle: if you really want to call it even, Give back the bits and stop charging for my lessons.

Diamond Tiara: Even if your routine will never, how shall i say, take off!

Apple Bloom: Mom and dad left us something to remember them by. Come on!

Fluttershy: I don't think we shouldn't judge them, They seem perfectly happy with their choice.

Twilight Sparkle: i want this place to be spotless.

Sweetie Belle: No wait!

Cadance: Sometimes it's how you learn the most about yourself.

Trixie: Busy. i know.

Fluttershy: Ahem! can you move? you're blocking my path.

Apple Bloom: That is the best idea, ever!

Fluttershy: i will.

Applejack: Fine.

Rarity: Just who does she think she is?

Fluttershy: Iron will's not a monster, He's a minotaur.

Applejack: Is a second they spend destroying orchard!

Sweetie Belle: And i can win the award for most traditional!

Ember: But i'm right.

Rainbow Dash: I was hoping you'd say that. come with me.

Yona: Yona no blame bird. yona no want to be around yona either.

Twilight Sparkle: You do?

Pinkie Pie: Those apple turn overs aren't gonna apple themselves.

Applejack: what do you say, rarity?

Fluttershy: No! you simply must wait.

Rarity: You, sir, are the most uncharming prince I have ever met!

Gallus: no, it should be a museum, with all the tree's history and artifacts!

Rarity: Now we can't perform tonight!

Twilight Sparkle: Hmm.

Twilight Sparkle: It was.

Rarity: you leave ponyville alone!

Sunset Shimmer: It's our only chance of getting our of here and helping our friends.

Sweetie Belle: The key is to remain calm.

Scootaloo: Yeah, i'd never believe it.

Twilight Sparkle: Of course losing the golden oak library was hard for you too!

Twilight Sparkle: I think she's cured now fluttershy.

Twilight Sparkle: You know. 'cause we're friends.

Scootaloo: um, no.

Thorax: Well, next time, ask before you run off.

Shining Armor: I'm sorry, fatherhood is way more stressful than i ever thought.

Spitfire: And the original crest with the wonderbolts motto on it.

Pinkie Pie: Meet somepony new?

Discord: I didn't!

Spike: Guess i'll just stand back here doing nothing.

Spike: Of course it's weird that she meant me, her and the spellbook.

Twilight Sparkle: Hold onto me.

Fluttershy: You really think it'll work?

Fluttershy: I tried, but you should've seen those ponies laughing at me.

Rainbow Dash: Turns out the only thing i liked more than flying fast.

Pinkie Pie: Applejack, you broke your Pinkie promise! Apologize!

Applejack: i know we're supposed to be able to handle things on our own, but i've never been happier to see two ponies in my whole life!

Trixie: Well, i suppose i could consider the trip.

Discord: Missus Cake!

Twilight Sparkle: Aha! that makes no sense. See? She's hiding like something's about to fall from the sky.

Apple Bloom: plus we'll get 'em done Twice as fast and won't miss out on any of the harvest!

Rarity: Oh.

Pinkie Pie: Now I have no idea who do-doned it!

Twilight Sparkle: I will be presiding over the ceremony, but would very much like you and your friends To help with the preparations for this wonderful occasion.

Twilight Sparkle: Though i'm glad you're in the antique store too.

Fluttershy: The message doesn't get across.

Tirek: we worked together as you asked!

Granny Smith: Starin' at you from beyond the grave?

Rarity: Applejack, darling.

Spike: Why, that's a big responsibility.

Rarity: I just can't believe that sweetie belle.

Ocellus: That's twice the learning!

Scootaloo: Just because i look up to you, Doesn't mean i have to be you!

Pinkie Pie: Come on, put on those skates over there.

Cozy Glow: I did my part freaking out the Pegasi.

Iron Will: You see my friends, If my techniques can work for This shy little pony, then they Can work for anypony!

Fluttershy: Are you alright?

Spike: Maybe you should talk to them. I bet they're feeling the same way.

Applejack: Fluttershy, meet autumn blaze.

Twilight Sparkle: will be?

Applejack: None of this would've happened if you weren't tryin' to show off. As usual.

Twilight Sparkle: But they'll never get better if they don't know what to work on.

Spike: What are you talking about? you said you wanted to be helpful.

Star Swirl: You cannot bring only the pillars back.

Twilight Sparkle: But that doesn't mean you shouldn't be studying for yours!

Discord: What kind of a friend do you think i am?

Apple Bloom: What?

Sunburst: I can't believe you figured out How to trigger her nesting response.

Apple Bloom: why you have a big apple as a cutie mark?

Rarity: But you said you wanted me to find the gems.

Rarity: And what about all those silly, unpronounceable names?

Fluttershy: Fuzzy legs made the sticky wall That made it difficult for you to see and move.

Spike: Why would she.

Sandbar: if they happened to be in canterlot for the day.

Twilight Sparkle: we are pretty incredible together.

Yona: Spiders, friends?

Twilight Sparkle: Well once we read Shadetail Evergreen's warning that the flower grants wishes.

Pinkie Pie: Absotively! instruction following starting, now!

Apple Bloom: If anypony deserves a very special somepony, it's her.

Scootaloo: You ready for tonight?

Sweetie Belle: Evil!

Fluttershy: I've gathered all of the animals like you asked, starlight glimmer.

Twilight Sparkle: That was me trying to warn myself not to worry so much!

Sweetie Belle: We just need to talk to him again.

Sweetie Belle: Well, i guess it's a good thing rarity isn't here.

Spike: Oh yeah.

Sunburst: And starlight and i share a lot of things too.

Rarity: Are we there yet?

Spike: i'm not i mean i'm sure about that.

Pinkie Pie: Oh, silly me, i must have put The confetti in the oven and the Cake in the confetti Cannons, again!

Mayor Mare: Exactly, we must do something to thank applejack for single hoofedly saving the town.

Pinkie Pie: We'll need fifteen bags of confetti And as many hooves as we can get.

Starlight: Surprise.

Yona: If, everycreature want to learn?

Apple Bloom: Now that's more like it!

Rarity: i will stay here and distract maud while you go get a pouch.

Spike: Thanks.

Trixie: for a minute I didn't think you were coming back And that you might be upset with me for some weird reason.

Rarity: You will support me in this endeavour by letting me keep this book just a little longer?

Rainbow Dash: Egghead.

Tirek: Unless, of course, pony errand boy is the role You've always wanted to play in this world.

Rarity: I just have two other boutiques.

Pinkie Pie: I want her to taste the rock candy we're gonna use for our.

Spitfire: With my new friend, lightning dust.

Spike: Oh, i mean, we don't have to.

Luna: Should we tell her that we've cleared out our royal suites so she and Spike can move in?

Big Macintosh: I hate to say i told you so, applejack, but.

Discord: Hey, i'm here to deliver a message.

Pinkie Pie: Thank you!

Spike: Would you two come with me?

Scootaloo: Is your talent spelling?

Fluttershy: There's no time for that. There's a cockatrice on the loose.

Rainbow Dash: And lost every time! she just kept goin'!

Big Macintosh: Whoa!

Pinkie Pie: Whatever.

Applejack: I know we've had this day marked on the calendar for quite a while.

Applejack: I wish I could sugarcube. But Big Mac's not feelin' well today.

Applejack: We brought in the whole harvest with time to spare.

Rarity: So to speak.

Scootaloo: You're still gonna be wearing a wonderbolts uniform Though, right?

Spike: What about this book?

Rainbow Dash: And then you tried to stop her from doing that, right?

Applejack: Of course not.

Pinkie Pie: next year, i'm going to have to really step it up and.

Pinkie Pie: How about, queen meanie?

Scootaloo: You and sweetie belle can cheer On me and rainbow dash instead!

Twilight Sparkle: The first thing she'll see when she wakes up is herself Surrounded by all her friends.

Zephyr: Plain old regular, shoes?

Twilight Sparkle: that's, a good idea. thank you all. so much.

Rainbow Dash: Who's there?

Rainbow Dash: You can't be tied for the most daring pony!

Pinkie Pie: I got it here without a hitch.

Shining Armor: We can explain twilly, if it really is you.

Celestia: It seems we need to make adjustments To account for threats inside, the castle as well as out.

Trixie: Klutzy.

Starlight: What did you say?

Scootaloo: I just need to find a way to spend some time with her.

Twilight Sparkle: You stay here.

Starlight: Nobody makes friends with a total stress case.

Rainbow Dash: canterlot?

Fluttershy: thank you.

Rainbow Dash: It doesn't matter.

Spike: Hang on! i'm sure there's another one!

Pinkie Pie: I mean, cool.

Celestia: But nothing could prepare me for how proud I am right now.

Big Macintosh: eeyup.

Pinkie Pie: Hi, cranky! I have a gift for you.

Rarity: Don't worry, rarity is here To keep you safe and sound. ooh.

Granny Smith: We're closer to the cousin Goldie's than we are to home.

Rainbow Dash: all the times we've actually needed their help, and they show up for this?

Twilight Sparkle: Uh, i only ordered twelve.

Fluttershy: Oh, but i'm sure that if we've gotten our keys, You have too, twilight!

Spike: I bet i can prove you believe in love.

Apple Bloom: I don't know what Spur's so worried about. Bloofy and Biscuit are havin' fun.

Pinkie Pie: Feel free to use that in your next book.

Starlight: And i hear you're the best out there.

Chrysalis: A whisper here, a rumor there.

Fluttershy: I don't think I like this story very much.

Luna: And that princess.

Applejack: Stop!

Rainbow Dash: Yeah well, i was just, testing you guys.

Thorax: This guy!

Pinkie Pie: To eat silly! After all this heisting, we're gonna be hungry!

Discord: Disturb them? why, wouldn't dream of it.

Applejack: well sure but, have you always run every single one of these here machines full bore, all day, every day?

Caballeron: We can't have them escaping again.

Sweetie Belle: That would be perfect!

Pinkie Pie: yep, i do separate trips with each one.

Diamond Tiara: You three must come to my pool party. It'll be much cooler than this.

Applejack: nopony! that's who!

Zephyr: Fine. i'll just go live in the woods Like my foreponies before me.

Pinkie Pie: Have you ever heard of Cherrychanga?

Celestia: Oh! um, thank you.

Pinkie Pie: I'll get a real apology letter.

Pinkie Pie: Uh, i mean me.

Rarity: I'm talking even louder than i thought, aren't i!?

Rarity: You don't want to risk having that important role diminished Because you're tardy for your regal meeting greet.

Rainbow Dash: Yearling looks forward to her retirement.

Applejack: Now, what was that all about?

Rainbow Dash: Oh, sorry, guess it was nothing.

Fluttershy: You're all awfully anxious.

Smolder: no. you don't. but they do.

Starlight: And when you offered to help, i didn't listen.

Pinkie Pie: You know, the trip was really hard.

Goldie Delicious: You couldn't be around them too long and not feel a bit little lighter than air yourself.

Rarity: quit it.

Rainbow Dash: That's worse than clothes!

Fluttershy: My little meadow lark is right around this bend.

Fluttershy: Fresh and spiffy.

Pinkie Pie: Open, shut, open, shut, open, shut, open, shut.

Celestia: I fear that your friends being aware of your new power, could put them at great risk.

Applejack: Turns out, that when you are with folks you care about.

Rainbow Dash: Don't get too excited?

Spike: And then i walk over and light the torch.

Twilight Sparkle: Maybe he'll see that i take magic as seriously as he does.

Pinkie Pie: Well, duh.

Pinkie Pie: It's a book of memories.

Rarity: The castle isn't open for viewings today.

Twilight Sparkle: I think you're all over reacting.

Rarity: What's an attack construct!?

Pinkie Pie: Now i'm going to need some cocoa powder cocoa flakes, Ooh! cocoa bar!

Caballeron: offered to team up with her but, she refused.

Applejack: I've got so much cookin' and cleanin' and familyin' to do, I ain't got time for anything else!

Sunburst: the crystal heart's been around for millennia.

Rainbow Dash: You didn't.

Fluttershy: Oh! he could be trapped in a dark place with no way out!

Applejack: Right behind ya!

Rainbow Dash: Cool! now what would be even cooler, Is if we could find a treasure chamber or something!

Cozy Glow: Okay, stop.

Trixie: You two just get ready to run into the other tunnel.

Trixie: How long do i have to wait for my applesauce facial?

Twilight Sparkle: Nope.

Sunburst: Of course! powerful magic like that Would leave an impression on this place.

Applejack: They're back!

Spike: Unholster the lightning bolt!

Twilight Sparkle: You could try zecora.

Rainbow Dash: The object of the game is to get the closest to the stake.

Spike: and i am one hundred percent sure I can get the whole crystal empire to be your friend too.

Spike: oh. you mean to find first folio.

Pinkie Pie: We need to celebrate your Birthday, babies! 'cause you were just born today!

Sweetie Belle: which is it?

Rarity: Like you.

Diamond Tiara: I hope you've got something, because everything so far is unusable.

Twilight Sparkle: Is that, rainbow dash, walking?

Discord: You're welcome!

Fluttershy: Now, this is a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.

Starlight: Um, why are you here now?

Mrs. Cake: Next thing I knew, I was whipping up pear upside down cake, And i got my cutie mark!

Applejack: Nice going, fluttershy. get her to stop!

Rainbow Dash: Whoa pinkie, i guess that really was the problem we needed to solve.

Applejack: So lemme get all this straight.

Rarity: Nice?

Trixie: Told ya.

Zecora: I have many a healing brew.

Twilight Sparkle: Yeah. them.

Discord: oh That's not good enough for fluttershy. Should i make them fly?

Luna: I suggest you share your concerns with them.

Cadance: But how did you escape my bridesmaids!?

Applejack: You have been having an awful lot of trouble with those things.

Rainbow Dash: So, why don't you come with me over to sweet apple acres?

Twilight Sparkle: uh, Gotta go.

Twilight Sparkle: How's tonight's party coming?

Starlight: You don't think that's it, do you?

Luna: Are you sure you don't want me to go as well?

Pinkie Pie: Too old for free candy?

Twilight Sparkle: You'll discover a whole new pony underneath.

Applejack: He needs his rest so we can give him as a gift To my relatives in appaloosa.

Rarity: My friends!

Twilight Sparkle: Strange weather patterns, out of control plants.

Rarity: Not everything is a competition.

Spike: Did you hear anything?

Spike: And so the paradise the ponies had found was soon lost.

Twilight Sparkle: You actually got a griffon a cutie mark For the first time in recorded history?

Thorax: Yes.

Twilight Sparkle: And just what do you think you're doing?

Spike: Sugar Belle's gonna love it!

Apple Bloom: Are you kiddin' me crusaders?

Applejack: Why apple bloom, i think you're ready to hit the rodeo circuit right now.

Rainbow Dash: Spit it out!

Pinkie Pie: Really?

Ocellus: What are you doing?

Twilight Sparkle: Is it a, bird?

Celestia: i'm glad to see you've found a way to share your unique gift, sunburst.

Rainbow Dash: Okay. She's strong, fast, And somehow knows what's gonna happen ahead of time.

Twilight Sparkle: Speaking of princesses, Aren't you gonna ask celestia for her help as well?

Rainbow Dash: Darn it! Now you got me feeling all sappy!

AK Yearling: Not so fast, caballeron!

Grogar: the bell cannot be destroyed.

Twilight Sparkle: You did?

Gabby: that is amazing! then what?

Scootaloo: Look!

Pinkie Pie: That sounds fun.

Twilight Sparkle: And gusty could tell he was ready for battle.

Rainbow Dash: Wait!

Rarity: Oh, she looks great.

Twilight Sparkle: We've got to put a stop to this once and for all!

Discord: Well there isn't any time!

Apple Bloom: That's a yes.

Chrysalis: perhaps i should be the one to lead us.

Fluttershy: That's terrible.

Applejack: Are you sure you know which way to go?

Luna: Fair villagers, please do not back away.

Spike: Here you go, fluttershy! game on!

Chrysalis: How do i know you won't take my magic and leave me?

Shining Armor: And this one reminds me of flurry too.

Apple Bloom: Yes siree!

Twilight Sparkle: Princess celestia helped me reach out to all the kingdoms.

Spike: Oh, uh, hi your lordship. uh, i was just going home.

Rarity: What? i really mean it this time.

Twilight Sparkle: I know i've finished one of starswirl's spells before, But this one was on a whole different level.

Twilight Sparkle: That's a good idea, and friendship solution number forty eight.

Applejack: All i'm sayin', is that you may have plenty of brawn.

Big Macintosh: uh, nope.

Rarity: well, i'm in.

Scootaloo: We're sorry.

Gallus: hey! stop!

Granny Smith: well now, it musta been the last confluence, i reckon.

Twilight Sparkle: Whoever has the best reason to go should get the ticket.

Rarity: I am now modeling the rather unattractive, and frankly itchy, original Wonderbolts flying costume.

Twilight Sparkle: I'm not sure anything we know is the same.

Applejack: You actually got them all the way up here?

Spike: Incoming!

Rarity: She obviously needs help.

Big Macintosh: Hey!

Prince Rutherford: Pink pony ask too many questions.

Twilight Sparkle: Look everypony, i know how hard it is to say goodbye.

Spike: She's totally gonna lose it! keep it together buddy, i gotta stay strong, for twilight!

Pinkie Pie: Worried?

Rainbow Dash: I know now that i should've been honest with you from the start Because lying to your friends is wrong.

Apple Bloom: That's it!

Twilight Sparkle: But, Well, it doesn't seem like you need any help.

Spike: Although it could be, it's a throw pillow, They're more casual, you can use them anywhere.

Starlight: Wow. uh, ok.

Rainbow Dash: You.

Starlight: I need to talk to twilight.

Rarity: Like it or love it?

Applejack: yeah, amazing.

Big Macintosh: Eeyup.

Pinkie Pie: And ghastly gorge is so urgh.

Celestia: Perhaps we should end the games now And declare a tie.

Twilight Sparkle: Yes. we're looking for a book.

Spike: Snap out of it!

Pinkie Pie: Oh yeah.

Twilight Sparkle: Rumor has it, he found a way to banish them to another world, one where he believed their magic power would be lost.

Pinkie Pie: Old pinkie pie's not so sure New fluttershy is such a good Idea after all.

Trixie: follow me!

Fluttershy: Oh, gosh, pinkie, i love your New style.

Spike: uh twilight?

Twilight Sparkle: Oh, sorry girls.

Sunset Shimmer: Unless you think the counter-spell is ready to be played now.

Applejack: Sorry, little sis, but your apple selling days are over.

Discord: Unless you don't think you're good enough to teach me.

Quibble Pants: Ok i'll give you that one, I mean we could have been done for.

Sweetie Belle: For pete's sake, it's all red!

Fluttershy: I'm talking about mom's flowers.

Shining Armor: I think i speak for both of us when i say, we couldn't be more excited to have you here.

Applejack: Keep it up!

Rarity: Confident warrior!

Pinkie Pie: What's your name?

Cozy Glow: Oh, oh, not too tight. We don't want to hurt the chancellor.

Apple Bloom: You sounded like you were catchin' a cold or.

Spike: Thought we'd meet you at the station!

Starlight: what kind of name is that?

Sweetie Belle: I'm sure gonna miss that bad seed.

Spitfire: Ya think you're hot stuff?

Pinkie Pie: She ate all of these, right?

Scootaloo: You saw how shifty he was acting earlier, There's no way he'll tell us what he's doing.

Pinkie Pie: Whoa what a coincidence, cause i was just, you know.

Rainbow Dash: Whatever!

Granny Smith: Eh, has anypony seen applejack?

Pinkie Pie: Yah!

Rarity: Ooh! the sewing machines i ordered for my class!

Fluttershy: I'm happy to be here.

Scootaloo: They're coming.

Silverstream: Where's yona?

Pinkie Pie: I knew rarity and applejack wanted to get Out of their element.

Fluttershy: I think it's lovely.

Discord: As a bird.

Quibble Pants: but i am saying, that this would totally go along my whole thing about puzzle solving except.

Twilight Sparkle: Thanks a lot shining armor.

Spike: Raising the sun every morning was so hard.

Twilight Sparkle: Well.

Rarity: I'm not sure he made the trip down with us, dear.

Twilight Sparkle: Oh, come on.

Spike: That's it. we've got to go talk to applejack.

Smolder: Pretty soon you'll leave and strike out on your own.

Applejack: big mac wasn't harvesting the carrots.

Cozy Glow: can we get on with this please?

Spike: No! no! of course not! but.

Fluttershy: it's okay angel! you're okay, you're okay!

Twilight Sparkle: What if instead she starts thinking i'm not taking my studies on friendship seriously?

Discord: A gift from someone close to you.

Apple Bloom: Um, gabby, i hate to break it to you but.

Granny Smith: I don't know, but I don't see how we can go back now either.

Starlight: Whoa, How long are you staying?

Twilight Sparkle: We'll have to find another way to get the honey.

Rarity: you simply must give yourself over to the idea that you are off duty, and try to relax.

Pinkie Pie: Hey, this is pretty good!

Pinkie Pie: Not usually.

AK Yearling: what!? no! look are any of you here for my actual book signing?

Spike: The team that finds the most wins a private tour Of the canterlot archives with princess celestia.

Spitfire: Let me give you a different scenario.

Fluttershy: Then, the land would be covered in darkness, for, eternity.

Rarity: Me too, and i was there.

Apple Bloom: a griffon?

Rainbow Dash: Uh, yeah! let's go already!

Sandbar: You all better get clear.

Sunset Shimmer: Oh, and i'd keep an eye on your mutt.

Pinkie Pie: That was a close one gummy.

Flim: You've got swollen hooves and hindquarters or terrible bridle bit cleft.

Flam: The fact is your granny is happier now than before she tried it.

Twilight Sparkle: I don't see any dragons.

Rainbow Dash: this is it?

Rainbow Dash: And i know that chs has never won The friendship games even once.

Twilight Sparkle: Oh, Fluttershy.

Twilight Sparkle: To make the judge chortle, chuckle, giggle, guffaw, hoot and holler, whoop it up, and party down.

Goldie Delicious: Let's see here, i got a stack of books here someplace.

Cheerilee: Well, this has been, strange.

Starlight: You need to put yourselves in one another's shoes.

Celestia: When I sent you to Ponyville, I had high hopes.

Twilight Sparkle: Well, we're just gonna have to hoof it!

Starlight: Oh, well it looks like you're really narrowing it down.

Applejack: sure is. ok, who's going to get her?

Fluttershy: You, want to, be a watch?

Fluttershy: Raising the sun every morning was so hard.

Rainbow Dash: Trixie's just a loudmouth.

Scootaloo: So what do you say? will you help me make my race cart?

Twilight Sparkle: Quick, find me that old copy of predictions and prophecies.

Fluttershy: You really should be more careful. Somepony could get hurt.

Rarity: It's fine, my dear.

Spitfire: Well, let me tell you, you don't!

Sunset Shimmer: Nice work spike.

Mrs. Cake: I pride myself on baking under pressure, but I just, Oh dear.

Granny Smith: i'm sorry sunburst without your teammate you can't play neither.

Rarity: Who is she anyway?

Applejack: It still takes every last pony in equestria, doin' their part.

Pinkie Pie: Tell me all about it big time!

Spike: Even the unicorns' magic was powerless against the storm.

Apple Bloom: I think a trap went off!

Autumn Blaze: Yes of course.

Twilight Sparkle: We'd best keep our elements on at all times until further notice.

Twilight Sparkle: Twenty minutes!?

Rainbow Dash: Look at it this way.

Rainbow Dash: Seriously! this is the most relaxed i've been all day.

Twilight Sparkle: but it turns out, That's just not meant to be.

Granny Smith: Bah hah!

Starlight: Cool.

Autumn Blaze: It's a long story.

Rainbow Dash: And we're here to remind you how awesome you are, Mane or no mane!

Thorax: He's leading us to a swarm waiting to attack.

Spike: Uh, what's hibernation?

Rarity: Quite.

Pinkie Pie: you can't run before you can walk.

Rarity: It will take rearranging all the music, and we just don't have time.

Applejack: Where the heck are these thing coming from?

Apple Bloom: We might have something worth coming down for.

Rarity: what's happening?

Twilight Sparkle: Aw fluttershy, we just don't want you to miss out.

Spike: Whoa!

Pinkie Pie: will you please help me?!

Applejack: maybe there's a little somethin' to be scared of.

Starlight: Oh, you don't need me to decide that. Whatever you think is probably best.

Rainbow Dash: Forget it, i don't like ponies touching my hooves.

Discord: I won the spellvenger hunt!

Rainbow Dash: You made me clip my wing.

Pinkie Pie: twilight, we don't have much time!

Fluttershy: Oh, i understand the language of all kinds of creatures!

Rarity: Like it?

Thorax: Lucky for us, you weren't a lost cause.

Applejack: See anything?

Fluttershy: Yes.

Applejack: Some ponies, sheesh.

Twilight Sparkle: No, just the opposite, actually.

Zephyr: Not for long if I can't remember our slogan but, yeah.

Rockhoof: mage meadowbrook.

Rainbow Dash: Go get your cutie marks back.

Fluttershy: Oh, no.

Applejack: Come on y'all! Time to prove we've still got the magic of friendship inside us!

Rainbow Dash: Help!

Rarity: Exile.

Rarity: oh! terribly sorry yona. All these dresses i'm sewing for the dance Have me completely frazzled!

Fluttershy: but why? aren't you proud of your adventures?

Rarity: i'm i'm i-i-i-i'm glad to see you like pouch.

Pinkie Pie: My friends laugh with me, not at me.

Twilight Sparkle: From what i've seen, she's the real thing.

Granny Smith: It's, it's beautiful.

Rainbow Dash: I prefer to think of them as everypony's trophies.

Sweetie Belle: I think they're gonna drink it!

Goldie Delicious: I'm sure i could wrangle it.

Pinkie Pie: Hmm, now what was it?

Twilight Sparkle: And sunburst practically knows every spell that ever was.

Rarity: And all is well.

Ocellus: it was. but when we used the broken parts to build something new, this happened.

Starlight: Not if you could use real magic.

Pinkie Pie: What!?

Twilight Sparkle: library!

Starlight: er Tea, anypony? cucumber sandwich?

Discord: If only i weren't super busy this evening.

Mrs. Cake: But one day, your mom brought me some candied pears, eggs, flour, Sugar and vanilla.

Rainbow Dash: Aww.

Apple Bloom: What if the crusaders drift apart?

Rainbow Dash: well, we are kind of an awesome team.

Applejack: not spiffy 'em up.

Spike: Are you sure that's a good idea?

Twilight Sparkle: Oh, what would a brave pony like rainbow dash do?

Scootaloo: How can i explain it? like the wonderbolts.

Apple Bloom: Uh, could you excuse us for a moment?

Pinkie Pie: Don't worry rainbow!

Starlight: You both love books.

Trixie: Wow.

Rarity: So she tweaks a few ponies every now and then.

Rainbow Dash: This is where they make the snowflakes.

Rainbow Dash: You wouldn't really get it unless you were there.

Fluttershy: Hello, um.

Applejack: Which little protegee?

Starlight: Your secret's safe with me.

Discord: Maybe i just need another set of eyes on this.

Rarity: no thanks!

Star Swirl: There's no way to befriend a pony like that.

Trixie: And you're not backing out? The two of us sleeping in that cozy caravan could get tricky.

Pinkie Pie: Right, Why don't we continue this discussion Over some delicious canned peanut brittle?

Rainbow Dash: Ak! i've got to talk to you! it's an emergency!

Starlight: I could use magic to save you, And make you appear in the black box.

Zecora: If not for you, i would not be cured.

Pinkie Pie: Time travel!?

Trixie: I definitely don't feel like my heart is breaking Into a million pieces.

Trixie: Honestly, i don't think i could have stood one more second On the road.

Smolder: Though now that dragons and ponies are friends, I guess that's off the table.

Pinkie Pie: Go pinkie.

Sweetie Belle: Hey zipporwhill. what are you doing here?

Starlight: Just remember how you'd feel If someone said those things to you.

Rarity: You didn't like that much, did you?

Smolder: Well we don't have feathers for starters.

Rarity: I can't believe we lost her.

Twilight Sparkle: but hurry up! we're almost to the best part!

Fluttershy: I truly wish i'd spend more time with boulder because.

Apple Bloom: Really? why'd you move back?

Apple Bloom: Look!

Rainbow Dash: Ladies and gentle yaks!

Rainbow Dash: Right.

Twilight Sparkle: Your turn, Fluttershy.

Rarity: Look upon me equestria, for I, am, rarity!

Yona: Yona, can't, run, faster!

Rainbow Dash: i'm awesome.

Rarity: I'm just relieved to finally be done.

Pinkie Pie: I hope there's cotton candy!

Pinkie Pie: Is it blue?

Applejack: I bet this here's the problem that fluttershy and i can help y'all with.

Twilight Sparkle: And with the grand galloping gala coming up, I bet you could totally get some of them To buy your dresses.

Spike: Because you have a big mouth.

Spike: How can you fall for her lameness? She's just a show off.

Tirek: It's impossible for any creature other than, a draconequus, to control.

Sweetie Belle: I guess rarity wasn't trying to steal the spotlight.

Applejack: She made a liar outta me. that's different.

Pinkie Pie: Maud. i thought you couldn't make a friend without my help.

Apple Bloom: And it totally would have worked!

Chrysalis: well it sounded easy.

Spike: i don't know why we keep running out at the castle.

Twilight Sparkle: I'm happy to report that.

Twilight Sparkle: and you've barely made a dent in the clutter!

Sugar Belle: And why are you leaning like that?

Twilight Sparkle: So.

Mrs. Cake: Oh, it's fine dear. trixie was already here. I told her everything she needs to know.

Rainbow Dash: Kind of an inside joke from this weekend.

Pinkie Pie: Maybe i can fix it.

Twilight Sparkle: Celestia's always kind to everypony.

Pinkie Pie: No, everything is not ok!

Rarity: How could you do this to me!? You stole my secret diary and published it for all the world to read!

Discord: You can take them and leave the game, Or you can carry on, aimlessly wandering this maze.

Applejack: Just be sure to get your heads in the game before tomorrow.

Rarity: Think twilight, when have you completed a difficult magical task, And in doing so, encouraged another pony to do the same?

Twilight Sparkle: All right everypony.

Pinkie Pie: What?

Trixie: I'll sleep under the stars where at least the wild animals Will be quieter than you!

Starlight: How do i know you aren't some other changeling Pretending to be thorax?

Pinkie Pie: Your plans are the most unlamest!

Twilight Sparkle: This is your mission.

Fluttershy: And he certainly knows his stuff when it comes to buildings.

Rainbow Dash: Oh, yeah, we just came to make sure you're all right.

Rainbow Dash: ok, you're about to take your first flight As an actual wonderbolt.

Shining Armor: the castle is surrounded by shards of queen chrysalis' throne.

Twilight Sparkle: But i am.

Applejack: Who in the hay is, countess coloratura?

Thorax: And who better to help us do that than the only changeling Who never stopped protecting us?

Rarity: You've more than earned them.

Apple Bloom: Really?

Twilight Sparkle: dear princess celestia, This week, my very talented friend rarity learned.

Starlight: Right. got it.

Rainbow Dash: Once a month, she comes into ponyville.

Applejack: Shouldn't somepony do something?

Spike: Check!

Trixie: Hey, discord? wanna see the new trick i've been working on?

Twilight Sparkle: It's just a test!?

Rarity: Like it?

Trixie: I barely even know you!

Fluttershy: I see that discord's far from perfect.

Applejack: If they try anything slippery, then things are gonna get sticky.

Rainbow Dash: And my team gave the all clear from fillydelphia to las pegasus.

Applejack: Vampire fruit bats are attacking sweet apple acres!

Twilight Sparkle: How come your knee didn't get pinchy!? That isn't just scary, it's downright dangerous!

Rainbow Dash: Lucky for you!

Fluttershy: I'll take a bunch of these.

Twilight Sparkle: I didn't even know it was gonna happen.

Scootaloo: And let's win this thing!

Rainbow Dash: Weather for the coronation is sunny skies!

Rainbow Dash: Karate, go!

Tirek: I am surprised that someone with your intellect Does not see this, friendship, is but a new form of imprisonment.

Big Macintosh: yep.

Twilight Sparkle: and no word from the ponies inside!

Spike: Zecora!

Starlight: Put it on my tab.

Twilight Sparkle: Wait, what are you doing out here?

Fluttershy: come on out, little guy. it's okay.

Trixie: And i'm sure we'll find out that waiting in that Super long line was worth it.

Pinkie Pie: A sonic boom and a rainbow can happen all at once!

Twilight Sparkle: Spoiler alert, it's this one.

Caballeron: Going anywhere.

Twilight Sparkle: There's only one other way spike Is gonna fulfill the debt he feels he owes you.

Gabby: Know who you are? know who you are?

Apple Bloom: That smooth talking pony stole our rescue!

Rarity: What if i just spruce up your, uh.

Scootaloo: And trying new stuff might even make us better At helping them.

Discord: Right, big mac?

Zecora: I'm afraid it is a mystery as well.

Rainbow Dash: I know how you feel!

Rainbow Dash: Okay, here's what we do.

Applejack: Maybe the great seedling really was here!

Pinkie Pie: That, was, amazing!

Applejack: Granny, don't you think you should take it kinda easy?

Apple Bloom: Come on! Before we lose the trail!

Rainbow Dash: What are you doing?

Spike: She could be miles away from here by now.

Cozy Glow: she'd let them come here with me.

Applejack: Anyhow, we gotta get 'em all talkin' again.

Rainbow Dash: Really? i mean, oh yeah, me.

Ocellus: Maybe we could've saved the tree.

Twilight Sparkle: She only has one cat.

Shining Armor: I've missed you kid. how was the train ride? i.

Spike: you said it!

Mayor Mare: Oh, I now pronounce you husband and wife.

Twilight Sparkle: I see what's going on.

Zecora: Zecora knows just what to do.

Rainbow Dash: And some kinda cool energy.

Spike: I mean you're kind of a, weirdo.

Applejack: Sorry, but that's all there Is to tell.

Twilight Sparkle: Call everypony back.

Twilight Sparkle: i don't know what to do. i don't know how to free them and i don't know how to stop sombra!

Neighsay: How dare you!

Applejack: There ain't. see?

Zecora: Now, apple bloom. do not be silly.

Apple Bloom: Oh, thank goodness.

Pinkie Pie: I've already checked discord's dimension, Granny smith's wax museum, and yakyakistan!

Sweetie Belle: Unicorn!

Discord: Before you summon me with that little spell she gave you.

Discord: All very well intended and noble on my part of course but.

Twilight Sparkle: Nah. pinkie pie's got that covered.

Twilight Sparkle: Who's very sorry he accidentally Knocked over your boat, right?

Big Macintosh: Just like when I asked you out, Just like Hearts and Hooves Day.

Zecora: But it seems that i'm ready to help you with yours.

Scootaloo: Aw, come on. we did lots of stuff That didn't have anything to do with getting a cutie mark.

Pinkie Pie: This is no time for the blame Game, pinkie!

Applejack: No! make it stop. Make it stop!

Twilight Sparkle: All of Equestria is at stake, and I can't do this alone.

Twilight Sparkle: But that's ok.

Fluttershy: Yay.

Twilight Sparkle: But we're here now, and it sure feels like something's wrong.

Twilight Sparkle: Sorry spike, but i have to convince the princess That nightmare moon is coming and we're running out of time.

Rainbow Dash: later!

Sweetie Belle: At least the barn's looking great for big mac's date.

Pinkie Pie: Here, pound cake!

Apple Bloom: Then what're we waiting for?

Rainbow Dash: Oh yeah? i just did!

Diamond Tiara: And i'm not struggling at all to find out Who i'm supposed to be and what i'm supposed To be doing with this mark that's already on my flank!

Applejack: And even with princess celestia leadin' the charge.

Rarity: I tried every trick i could think of.

Starlight: So, we're just going to wait in line for hours?

Rainbow Dash: And an attitude, and!

Twilight Sparkle: Oh my.

Granny Smith: Absolutely not!

Rainbow Dash: I can't stop that storm by myself, but i can still help!

Fluttershy: Wow twilight, i thought i was the only one who got nervous at social gatherings.

Discord: Those are very bad cards.

Star Swirl: Stygian! show yourself and face us!

Spike: Everypony does love surprises.

Pinkie Pie: It's a flyer about a one day sell out of used patio furniture!

Spike: hello everycreature!

Applejack: Rarity and i have to go to manehattan.

Rarity: I'm gonna have to work all night.

Sweetie Belle: Is that really a griffon?

Applejack: Big Mac! I thought you said.

Twilight Sparkle: About that, Spike and i were wondering what happened out there.

Caballeron: So the amulet, is as good as mine.

Spike: In with the portable ramp!

Twilight Sparkle: No, don't do it.

Cadance: Is that the candlestick he used to light the way when he was exploring the caverns of maretania?

Twilight Sparkle: I think we all know how bad rarity's been feeling.

Applejack: There's gotta be a reason.

Applejack: and, easy.

Sweetie Belle: We've got to get in there, now!

Twilight Sparkle: I look, ridiculous!

Pinkie Pie: I'll have to go there a lot more. So, I guess that's different, but I don't think I mind.

Twilight Sparkle: I just know princess celestia's gonna love that about you.

Rainbow Dash: There is literally, nothing cluttering this castle.

Spike: They're cool.

Twilight Sparkle: we have to keep trying!

Fluttershy: We have plenty of hay juice and marmalade to go around.

Pinkie Pie: Only way we'd find them funny now is If you put us all under some kind of spell!

Pinkie Pie: Who takes that long to say goodbye?

Luna: Normally i have all the time and solitude i need To work through my problems at my own pace.

Pinkie Pie: We'll take one!

Twilight Sparkle: Oh look! according to this one, the cakes are breaking up!

Pinkie Pie: Hey, gilda! word on the street is that griffonstone Has an amazing library chock full of answers!

Granny Smith: oh, we finished the harvest just fine.

Scootaloo: I lose!

Apple Bloom: The sheriff sort of has it in his mind that You're a no good outlaw lookin' to shut down the rodeo.

Chrysalis: Enough! Or the dragon's wings get plucked!

Applejack: if Pinkie's a twichin', you better listen.

Goldie Delicious: They had that magical, star kissed, Other side of a rainbow kind of love.

Twilight Sparkle: well, i knew it too! you're not the only pony to ever read a book you know.

Twilight Sparkle: Then.

Twilight Sparkle: The tree, the chest, this castle, and now the map.

Twilight Sparkle: I came as quickly as i could!

Twilight Sparkle: My books say that Zebras come from a faraway land.

Twilight Sparkle: Ghosts, goblins, and ghoulish figures?

Goldie Delicious: I know they loved each other very much.

Scootaloo: What's sweetie belle up to?

Rainbow Dash: How do i compete with that!?

Neighsay: As it should have from the start.

Fluttershy: Angel! oh you really shouldn't have run off like that, Ancient ruins are filled with all sorts of things that can hurt you!

Zecora: There are many mixtures in this room.

Scootaloo: After all, you're a crusader now. crusaders forever?

Rarity: But a captain of the royal guard!?

Ocellus: Yes! one down, five to go!

Fluttershy: We just wanted to let you know that we're so sorry you're hurt.

Twilight Sparkle: Mm hm.

Granny Smith: What!?

Apple Bloom: Aw, he don't seem so bad.

Silverstream: This is great!

Applejack: Well, hi.

Spike: I think, this guy needs you.

Rarity: Oh, my heavens!

Cheerilee: In this case, using mechanical work to convert potential energy Into kinetic energy.

Pinkie Pie: The wonderbolts!

Twilight Sparkle: What are you talking about?

Fluttershy: Take a deep breath.

Rainbow Dash: Tired?

Fluttershy: Once upon a time, before celestia.

Rainbow Dash: Flap those wings! faster!

Apple Bloom: Care to buy some apples?

Discord: I mean normal.

Twilight Sparkle: Your apple bucking hasn't just caused you problems.

Twilight Sparkle: Hello, bunyip, sir.

Rarity: And i gained tons of ideas for a new line Of camouflage clothing!

Rarity: Ruined!

Spike: Yeah, but i'm hoping i can be the announcer again!

Twilight Sparkle: Okay, backup plan to the backup plan.

Twilight Sparkle: Wha? but.

Discord: Well let me try and paint her a picture, dearest.

Star Swirl: more importantly, we no longer need ponhenge To send our foe back to limbo.

Tirek: Still think chaos magic is a good idea?

Starlight: Right after i take care of what i am sure Is an even smaller student problem than the last one.

Maud: It tastes like apples.

Smolder: It's just kinda weird, isn't it?

Twilight Sparkle: this is gonna be the bestest slumber party ever!

Twilight Sparkle: Just not here.

Apple Bloom: We're the cutie mark crusaders.

Pinkie Pie: This is definitely the right direction.

Twilight Sparkle: maybe they don't think we're up to the responsibility of protecting equestria after all!

Twilight Sparkle: What about telling stories?

Twilight Sparkle: And what would you like to learn, little one?

Twilight Sparkle: Oh!

Celestia: my sister and i have decided the time for us to retire is upon us.

Applejack: Rainbow dash just tripped me!

Pinkie Pie: scuse me.

Granny Smith: You have to say so. carnfangled modern doohickey!

AK Yearling: I can just blend in with all the daring do cosplayers.

Hoofar: Though i'd suggest heading back to ponyville, I-i'm not sure saddle arabia is ready for, this.

Thorax: It's a changeling hive. it shifts and changes like we do.

Twilight Sparkle: Can you see outside!?

Spike: Yeah, knock on wood.

Twilight Sparkle: Look what i have!

Granny Smith: Oh, we ventured far and wide, Collecting new seeds and selling old. But my pa was the finest seed collector in all equestria.

Flam: Ah ah ah! unnecessary!

Spike: Rarity, you have to get out of here.

Luna: Humph!

Rainbow Dash: And you know what that means. It means it's up to ponyville's pegasi to bring that water up to cloudsdale.

Applejack: Map callin' me to a big city like manehattan?

Pinkie Pie: Fine. then we'll have to go somewhere new Where we can grow some new food.

Applejack: That should feel pretty good.

Rarity: All of those unfinished seams.

Discord: I'll simply make them.

Rainbow Dash: I'm gonna need every pegasus to break the record, including you.

Pinkie Pie: Yes?

Rainbow Dash: I'm gonna try and get in first and beat the crowd So i can get back to the tournament faster.

Pinkie Pie: She probably can't remember our faces!

Twilight Sparkle: I for one, think you are three very lucky fillies.

Apple Bloom: Well, that's silly!

Pinkie Pie: Oh well, A party is still a party, even with only two guests.

Apple Bloom: We're getting fitted for water skis!

Spike: but giving her the space to make her own decisions worked pretty well.

Tirek: It holds that magic until it is released by this spell.

Rarity: Oh, you were serious.

Sandbar: Ok. enough!

Scootaloo: Let's face it, nothing very juicy happens at this school.

Pinkie Pie: Already?

Twilight Sparkle: I hope the princess was right.

Gallus: I think i'd be better off studying the plumbing book, this stuff is impossible.

Quibble Pants: Whoa!

Trixie: You think you have more magical talent?

Twilight Sparkle: I know you're upset, but you don't need to push me.

Starlight: What?

Iron Will: What did you say?

Fluttershy: I'll talk to him.

Rainbow Dash: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Iron Will: That was just the first heat of ten.

Pinkie Pie: I won't let you down.

Pinkie Pie: just like maud's going to lose her mind when she sees the gift i'm giving her!

Spike: Okay, Okay.

Applejack: That kind of question is Fine pinkie.

Maud: that's even longer than forever.

Diamond Tiara: They messed with the wrong pony!

Applejack: Is there, anything else you can tell us about them?

Twilight Sparkle: We've been at this for hours.

Starlight: Great. let me know when it's ready.

Starlight: There's plenty of high quality inns To stay at on the way. Don't worry about it.

Hoofar: Steaming hot beverage?

Applejack: I'll hold her still.

Rainbow Dash: Are we done yet?

Big Macintosh: you were supposed to tell rich the simple truth, But instead you made things worse, with a giant lie!

Apple Bloom: Okay, crusaders!

Starlight: You get the sticks, i'll get the streamers.

Spike: That sounds important.

Discord: I'm reformed, don't you remember?

Fluttershy: too quiet.

Twilight Sparkle: I was about to come and get you But then i got distracted.

Spike: The most beautiful creature in the world.

Celestia: I'd like to announce the winner Of this year's fall formal crown.

Starlight: are you kidding?

Applejack: Maybe you two should try it sometime.

Apple Bloom: It may as well be.

Twilight Sparkle: Now quick, lock the doors!

Starlight: Actually, i'm starlight. Starlight glimmer.

Pinkie Pie: I thought a good party might turn that frown upside down!

Sweetie Belle: No problem.

Fluttershy: Um, you don't know this about me But, i'm pretty good with animals.

Twilight Sparkle: It could make things pretty confusing if Canterlot High all of a sudden had two of all of you.

Big Macintosh: Eeyup.

Twilight Sparkle: This doesn't make any sense.

Spike: I have to win the gauntlet of fire!

Apple Bloom: Come on Bloofy! Come on, come on!

Scootaloo: Physics?

Cheerilee: Actually, in a way, you're all right.

Iron Will: But i pity the fool who doubts Iron will's methods. You don't doubt me, do you?

Apple Bloom: I just don't understand why you went So crazy there at the end of the race.

Rarity: That is how applejack thanked me.

Apple Bloom: Yeah, we'll listen to you from now on.

Pinkie Pie: Maybe we should talk a little later.

Flam: Do you really want to be the pony who takes all that happiness away?

Rarity: So then, what could've given us all the same nightmare?

Rainbow Dash: What?! no! look around us! henchponies. caballeron!

Celestia: My most faithful student, twilight sparkle, has done many extraordinary things since she's lived in ponyville.

Luna: I try my best to make sure the ponies in this castle Sleep peacefully.

Rainbow Dash: The wild blue yonder is in our hotel?

Sandbar: so?

Twilight Sparkle: Not only do i get to see the baby and take part In the ceremony that helps maintain the magic of the crystal empire.

Spike: maybe we should just wait here.

Cheerilee: Um, apple bloom. is granny smith here?

Trixie: Welcome class.

Gabby: But it just always seemed like the harder I tried, the less I fit in.

Sweetie Belle: and now we'll probably never see her again! it's hopeless!

Pinkie Pie: Applejack.

Rarity: He really was an excellent pet.

Scootaloo: We might not even need the rodeo 'cause we'll get cutie marks for our sleuthing skills.

Applejack: I promise to make ponyville Proud!

Twilight Sparkle: No, there's nothing fun about this!

Twilight Sparkle: That is why it's called an independent study program.

Pinkie Pie: Me neither! unless you count a royal order Of party planners memorial library.

Celestia: Enough.

Thorax: There's theater.

Maud: i'd like to return this pouch for my sister's party cannon please.

Trixie: What are you waiting for? Use some magic to get us out of here!

Twilight Sparkle: Be careful with those wings, rarity. They're made from gossamer and morning dew.

Sandbar: The tree grew the elements. and then the box with six locks.

Trixie: You there, what are you doing?

Rainbow Dash: Celestia hasn't even raised the sun yet!

Rainbow Dash: I would draw their attention With my super speed strut.

Discord: only if it's not too much trouble, and it's red.

Rarity: without her approval, a restaurant simply cannot survive.

Rainbow Dash: Remember, professionalism.

Fluttershy: Maybe not! look!

Sweetie Belle: Scootaloo?

Rarity: Shampoo.

Discord: Trapped in Grogar's Bell.

Twilight Sparkle: If our friends could enjoy three full days with discord that much, It must have something to do With the specific things they did together!

Spike: And zecora.

Rainbow Dash: No! one more time!

Rainbow Dash: Except now there's triplicates, and quadruplicates!

Discord: Oh, now where was i?

Twilight Sparkle: Spike, if you're done searching for the changeling, Starlight and i could use your help.

Fluttershy: Girls, thank goodness i found you.

Rarity: it's been so long since we've had a relaxing day at the spa together. i'm quite certain she'll be along any moment.

Apple Bloom: Yeah. Maybe she's just trying to be neighborly.

Tirek: because when you have to protect yourself, you don't have time for anypony else.

Rarity: Good!

Spike: yeah, gabby and i had a great day,.

Spike: It's us against the world, right?

Twilight Sparkle: You need to show this patient who's the boss!

Applejack: chores?

Starlight: It's her.

Spike: Twilight, applejack just saved my life.

Apple Bloom: This isn't a curse.

Chrysalis: Is that big, strong minotaur that scared of one little pony?

Pinkie Pie: I get different little, niggly feelings and they mean different things.

Gallus: Score!

Twilight Sparkle: Equestria's been falling apart around us and I didn't even notice!

Applejack: I'll see you at the dress rehearsal.

Granny Smith: Fluttershy?

Rainbow Dash: Point taken.

Rarity: Have you looked around this place? i'm the one who would be better off with no sister!

Rainbow Dash: You put this curse on us, now you're gonna uncurse us!

Discord: Spike, she's an imaginary one dimensional paper cut out skeleton.

Rarity: if you ask me, it's already a total disaster.

Rarity: Most unpleasant.

Gabby: Did it happen yet?

Spike: Now get out there.

Pinkie Pie: And then it's time for hearth's warming eve dinner!

Pinkie Pie: I love cheers!

Spike: I always wanted to be a super spy.

Rarity: What? oh yes, yes. that of course too.

Rarity: You've got a luxurious private sleeper car for a tree.

Apple Bloom: Well. Applejack and i are supposed to be camping Up at winsome falls this weekend.

Rockhoof: There's nothing you can't do with hard work.

Rarity: This all sounds splendid, but i don't even have a single Employee.

Spike: Sorry.

Sweetie Belle: Rarity, this is hard for me to say, but.

Spike: I know where Twilight is!

Twilight Sparkle: Really? but didn't i see you sewing with rarity?

Chrysalis: Isn't that right, Grogar?

Apple Bloom: I'd be happy to, twilight. spike?

Smolder: So even though you don't like any of the same stuff, You two are friends again?

Twilight Sparkle: Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?

Apple Bloom: Attention, everypony!

Rainbow Dash: I can see it now.

Starlight: No idea.

Rainbow Dash: There it is.

Twilight Sparkle: we didn't need to defeat them.

Spike: And any friend of spike the brave and glorious is a friend of the crystal empire, am i right?

Thorax: Do you really think you could help?

Trixie: It's the one place i knew i could find you.

Spike: I know you said nopony can help, but i'm no pony!

Starlight: Dad, you promised no pumpkie wumpkins in public.

Spitfire: Do you want to tell me why one of my most promising students Is flying like a balloon with a hole in it?

Applejack: What are you doing?

Spike: There it is!

Scootaloo: wow, apple bloom.

Sugar Belle: That one has the invitation for him.

Sweetie Belle: Really?

Pinkie Pie: uh! you did it again!

Fluttershy: I'm sure discord will catch tirek and this will all be over soon.

Spike: And the three leaders returned home to lick their wounds.

Applejack: No wonder granny never told us about any of this.

Rainbow Dash: whoa, whoa, whoa.

Sunset Shimmer: What!?

Scootaloo: We have a gabby gums column!

Spike: Oh really?

Cozy Glow: destroy the school of friendship?

Pinkie Pie: Something strange is definitely going on around here gummy.

Quibble Pants: Apparently this book is as close to sports As i'll ever get.

Maud: I think it would be best if i just go back to the rock farm and spend the rest of the week there.

Luna: They have never liked us, and they never shall.

Fluttershy: Lots of control.

Rarity: Check! re check! re check and re check!

Scootaloo: A what now?

Granny Smith: Dandy as a pansy in a plant pot!

Applejack: actually, lucky guess.

Spike: okay okay! i think i got it!

Ocellus: Nope! They're all legendary magical artifacts!

Fluttershy: It's not so much the grand galloping gala.

Starlight: Maud does have a way of making rocks really interesting But, i wanted to work on something a little more, us.

Zecora: Honestly, it's hard to tell.

Sandbar: What is, that thing?

Twilight Sparkle: And i can't wait to hear all about it!

Celestia: well, i hope you're enjoying yourself on your super relaxing picnic, sister.

Twilight Sparkle: Oh boy.

Sweetie Belle: you mean, you were all in on it?

Chrysalis: having others who will be there for you Is, pleasing.

Spike: I didn't know where else to go.

Sweetie Belle: I give up.

Starlight: Sorry about wasting bits on street food.

Celestia: You are now twilight sparkle, the princess of friendship.

Fluttershy: There's no way i'll fly with ten point o wing power tomorrow!

Applejack: Lemme re-light this fire.

Sweetie Belle: is this the something that's supposed to happen!?

Granny Smith: Apple bloom, how are them rsvps coming along?

Maud: Well, it's not in ponyville.

Apple Bloom: And it looks like your destiny is a whole lot like ours.

Pinkie Pie: I never expected that to happen!

Trixie: Well, twilight give up?

Rarity: Her nephew.

Pinkie Pie: And every year, she asks me why it's all deflated.

AK Yearling: If we can remove the giant ring at the bottom, the whole fortress will collapse!

Rainbow Dash: You ready or what?

Sunset Shimmer: Well.

Smolder: The best one wins a pile of gemstones.

Twilight Sparkle: An age spell?

Rarity: Oh! i love this picture.

Applejack: I'm here now and i'm not leavin' you home alone ever again.

Gabby: I can't believe it. i, i i won't believe it.

Trixie: Our friendship is stronger than a few angry words.

Applejack: uh what was the question again?

Pinkie Pie: i got you all a little something from my trip.

Rainbow Dash: Think fast. this is your big chance to impress her with your quick wit and courage.

Rainbow Dash: I still had half a nap to finish.

Discord: maybe you should just tell her.

Twilight Sparkle: Even the scary ones.

Spike: I know you told me to stay up there but you were down here for such a long time and you weren't answering and i got worried so i came down here.

Twilight Sparkle: Maybe you could tell us how the war started.

Twilight Sparkle: There are certain ponies i'd rather not associate with At the moment. rarity.

Pinkie Pie: i don't even have one.

Luna: Should we tell her that we've cleared out.

Fluttershy: We would've invited you to come along too But, we didn't want to interrupt your organizing.

Applejack: Why didn't i think of that?

Quibble Pants: Uh, please, please don't. just don't even mention the titles.

Rarity: Oh, with the right outfit you can do anything darling.

Twilight Sparkle: But starswirl says you betrayed them.

Pinkie Pie: It's winter break. I have hot cocoa, and we're about to bring a giant wagon of toys to little kids!

Celestia: you wouldn't need me anymore.

Pinkie Pie: Haven't seen you here in, like, forever-and-a-half!

Fluttershy: I hope you're happy.

Fluttershy: You could stub your toe, Or or trip on a loose stone, you have to be careful!

Pinkie Pie: yeah, this is gonna be great.

Granny Smith: Not so fast!

Apple Bloom: Huh?

Applejack: No Granny your, teeth are fine.

Sunset Shimmer: She needs to be dealt with.

Discord: At least my magic can do something.

Twilight Sparkle: Just like me, you have to make your own decisions.

Twilight Sparkle: i don't know, but we can't stay here.

Twilight Sparkle: I see.

Sugar Belle: And we'll make sure everything always works out just right.

Thorax: just like my own changelings.

Cozy Glow: You were saying?

Fluttershy: So beautiful.

Sunset Shimmer: No biggie.

Granny Smith: somewheres. um sorry pinkie, but you're disqualified.

Twilight Sparkle: And my poor baby dragon needs his sleep.

Twilight Sparkle: It was really creative though.

Sunset Shimmer: Not on my watch. I have a plan.

Twilight Sparkle: Applejack?

Fluttershy: In a new village.

Pinkie Pie: I can't wait for tomorrow to be today!

Starlight: I created a spell so we could relive playing a game In our childhood home.

Rarity: Oh manehattan, what you do to me!

Fluttershy: Maybe that's why you haven't heard of it?

Applejack: Well hi. I'm applejack, and this here is fluttershy.

Rarity: now applejack, if we are really to enjoy this time together.

Chrysalis: Twilight here was suspicious of my behavior all along.

Scootaloo: you're the best, you know that?

Rarity: oh. well, i'm just waiting for applejack.

Twilight Sparkle: That would practically guarantee my entrance Into the everton independent study program!

Granny Smith: what in the tater tarnation would make you say a thing like that?

Rarity: Now perhaps we can all at last take a moment to relax!

Trixie: Because you seem a little, what's the word?

Cozy Glow: Making friends with any other creature Must seem like a step down.

Celestia: Discord is the mischievous spirit of disharmony.

Twilight Sparkle: I mean.

Applejack: I hope Big Mac can figure out who gets what deliveries on his own.

Spike: Help!

Zecora: When it comes to break outs, i've seen all circumstances.

Applejack: Howdy, spike. hey, twilight.

Fluttershy: Until finally, the hooffields and mccolts Moved to separate mountains.

Twilight Sparkle: good. I don't want her to know anything about this.

Twilight Sparkle: If it were easy to learn, we wouldn't need a school.

Rarity: although i do expect Some sort of apology for last spring's debacle.

Applejack: I don't think I can face her and Tell her I didn't get that money To fix the broken roof.

Twilight Sparkle: Um, that's not an official position.

Fluttershy: Everyone else gets to ride, since the trip's too much for your little wings.

Celestia: halt, interloper!

Starlight: I guess it's not surprising that sunburst Got his cutie mark in magic and.

Spitfire: Quit yer whisperin' and give me five hundred laps!

Sweetie Belle: Maybe we added too much rainbow.

Twilight Sparkle: Stop time!

Spike: What's wrong, twilight?

Applejack: Oh no, you won't!

Pinkie Pie: Ah! it's the perfect plan!

Celestia: We believe in you and always have.

Rainbow Dash: But technically we weren't the last ponies to save equestria.

Applejack: You're a nacho away from no rolleycoaster!

Twilight Sparkle: And our friendships may be tested, but it will never ever be broken.

Pinkie Pie: I haven't found squat in any of the books i've been looking through.

Twilight Sparkle: I think we have all the magic we need right here.

Spike: I was really only scared for a second.

Luna: As always, i will guard the night.

Applejack: Rest when it's over, Big macintosh.

Rarity: Why not twilight?

Luna: so that her actions at the Fall Formal will become old news.

Fluttershy: I'm sorry photo finish but, I don't think I'll be able to make any of them.

Sassy Saddles: Are you actually saying we should, Cancel these orders!?

Spike: You don't look so good.

Rarity: there's a certain way to do everything at the dance.

Zephyr: It's just, the powers that be were so locked into their, required styles, and you know me.

Applejack: Not every last bit of her dark magic went with her.

Rainbow Dash: This door is not opening.

Twilight Sparkle: We would be honored if you would be the star of our play!

Pinkie Pie: Rainbow dash!

Discord: well i was going to hang these up all over the castle to celebrate your coronation, but apparently, it's a bit premature.

Twilight Sparkle: I guess we are.

Fluttershy: A dark spooky path that leads into unknown territory?

Pinkie Pie: Remember to only focus on the party string.

Twilight Sparkle: thanks rarity, It's a great dress.

Twilight Sparkle: We're a team, but we all stand out in different ways.

Pinkie Pie: Uh huh, sure.

Rarity: But i promise you, we will get those hooves by making This place feel just like all of the other restaurants On restaurant row!

Rarity: Breakfast, a big breakfast.

Applejack: And i know somepony that'd prefer If you stopped doin' those little events.

Rainbow Dash: so if this talisman is so important, why didn't you already save it?

Twilight Sparkle: Who is?

Applejack: Are you okay?

Sassy Saddles: They're perfect!

Granny Smith: That's a good one.

Scootaloo: Okay, so that's six wooden planks, four by eight plywood.

Rarity: I don't know if they believe you.

Twilight Sparkle: I was just trying to.

Rarity: Indeed. You have all the inner strength you need, But i think we prefer it coming From our sweet, regular fluttershy.

Twilight Sparkle: Nothing in this one either.

Rarity: Sometimes, it's about accepting each others' differences.

Rainbow Dash: Oh, this is too rich.

Twilight Sparkle: Listen to me!

Diamond Tiara: Yeah, because i have my cutie mark!

Rarity: Slumber one oh one.

Rarity: But of course darling.

Applejack: I, don't suppose you made motocross outfits?

Fluttershy: Then twilight would be stuck living In a castle that makes her feel.

Sweetie Belle: Besides, i know exactly what to do.

Granny Smith: An old pony like me needs her beauty rest but you young 'uns have a good time.

Applejack: why would you wanna start again now?

Rainbow Dash: What do you mean, wants you back?

Trixie: And she chose me! your pupil chose me! so ha. i win!

Rainbow Dash: Great. now there's no way out!

Apple Bloom: This is ridiculous! we need to go out and do somethin'!

Spike: I've also packed a telescope, apples, bananas, fruit punch.

Sunburst: Huh. I guess it is adorable.

Cozy Glow: Yes sir.

Star Swirl: I doubt we can save our homeland with a conversation.

Applejack: wow! those are all the places we went When we left to save equestria!

Zecora: Manes are tricky i have learned.

Zecora: A dragon's heart is prone to greed.

Twilight Sparkle: Even if you did take that two hour claw massage break.

Twilight Sparkle: Well, that was interesting all right.

Luna: I too have a sister who often shines more brightly than me.

Twilight Sparkle: Saving equestria is nice, but i'm afraid it'll take More than one semester to learn All there is to know about friendship.

Apple Bloom: There has got to be a better solution!

Rainbow Dash: Oh, come on!

Twilight Sparkle: um hi rarity, what's up?

Rainbow Dash: Yes! I would do anything!

Scootaloo: And toys. they need toys!

Spike: I brought my cider testing cup. are you ready to go try the samples?

Cadance: This is why we all hope you do us the honor of lighting the torch of the opening ceremony.

Fluttershy: Thanks, but, no thanks!

Spike: Twilight, he just wants to take your order.

Twilight Sparkle: After this, i move on to the b's.

Discord: Just your presence here is making me feel so much better.

Twilight Sparkle: Nearly all the signs have come true!

Fluttershy: Oops, everyone back to sleep now.

Starlight: Yes! we do!

Pinkie Pie: I'll just measure baking powder for you.

Rainbow Dash: Heh heh, You're such a rookie.

Applejack: Well, maybe there's a little somethin' to be scared of.

Rainbow Dash: Almost everything. does tank look alright to you?

Star Swirl: i know. i alerted the princesses as soon as i could.

Applejack: And you!

Rarity: Perhaps i should get the stilettos instead, What do you think?

Rarity: Aren't my wings smashing?

Pinkie Pie: He's starting to warm up, but still no smile.

Rarity: Chic!

Gabby: Yup. that's the one.

Starlight: Nope!

Twilight Sparkle: without the heart, the crystal empire is about to be buried under a mountain of ice and snow!

Spike: More of the green ones, please? i like the green ones.

Twilight Sparkle: but you said there'd be a doozy here at Froggy Bottom Bogg.

Rainbow Dash: Wait here.

Starlight: No! you're supposed to concentrate on the object! Not just teleporting!

Fluttershy: We're gonna be princess mi amore Cadenza's new bridesmaids!

Hoofar: seems like a perfectly honest, and fair trade to me.

Twilight Sparkle: Because Zecora is an evil enchantress who cursed us, and was gonna cook you up into soup.

Spike: Okay. i'll have the hay fries. Extra crispy!

Big Macintosh: So we are half pear?

Celestia: I'm listening.

Rarity: Seems you have more in common With the manehattan ponies than you thought.

Gabby: You're telling me!

Twilight Sparkle: No, thank you.

Twilight Sparkle: Hey, cerberus!

Pinkie Pie: Pilgrimaging?

Fluttershy: We shouldn't be bickering like this in front of our new friends.

Rainbow Dash: So i uh, i was trying to send them up, via, balloon mail.

Twilight Sparkle: The only difference now is that i have to compete.

Spike: So i'm taking you to twilight's castle Whether you like it or not.

Twilight Sparkle: Ugh! this is ridiculous!

Autumn Blaze: You were saying.

Trixie: But even trixie's made mistakes. ha, i know!

Applejack: I know they need lots of mud for the rodeo tomorrow.

Rainbow Dash: Oh yeah.

Celestia: Oh, of course not!

Tirek: Destroyed some crops, cause some trouble.

Scootaloo: And whole bunch of practice!

Rarity: tell me everything!

Pinkie Pie: So i just wanted to say i'm sorry!

Applejack: Well, you better check your hooves.

Rainbow Dash: I'm, on it!

Rainbow Dash: Hello!

Prince Rutherford: Made deep hole and fell into hole.

Twilight Sparkle: Sugar belle?

Applejack: nopony! nopony whatsoever!

Big Macintosh: I'm sorry sweetie belle, I'm just mad and i'm takin' it out on you.

Pinkie Pie: I am so so so excited because today i am planning the birthday bash of.

Gallus: Ok, if this is a test, there's got to be a way out.

Ocellus: i think we should turn this cave into a place For creatures to reflect on the tree's true gift.

Rarity: I was this close to getting that diamond.

Pinkie Pie: Candy cane stripes forever!

Twilight Sparkle: But power isn't why you make friends.

Pinkie Pie: I win again!

Fluttershy: Sounds amazing.

Sandbar: besides, it's where i'd go If something like that happened to me.

Spitfire: What about you?

Mrs. Cake: For starters, did you all know that it was your mom Who convinced me to pursue baking?

Maud: I do, but that wasn't a joke.

Thorax: It's, total chaos to non changelings.

Twilight Sparkle: I was trying to get rid of all the books that i don't need anymore.

Spike: See?

Twilight Sparkle: Pinkie!

Twilight Sparkle: Huh?

Applejack: Well let's go check it out!

Twilight Sparkle: I wonder which team vest i'll be wearing.

Apple Bloom: Hoo eee! those ribbons are the bees' knees.

Applejack: what the.

Twilight Sparkle: The most talented fliers in all of equestria?

Rarity: Was that the pony post!?

Fluttershy: Happy to, help, but.

Apple Bloom: Sweetie belle says it's your fault that terramar ra.

Twilight Sparkle: Uh, i just came to welcome you To our celebration.

Spike: See ya! Wouldn't want to be ya!

Pinkie Pie: And is good at games and.

Twilight Sparkle: Well at least you're getting a positive reaction.

Apple Bloom: Scootaloo, i know you have to go to cloudsdale To finish your report.

Celestia: If you honestly felt i was a bad actress, why didn't you tell me?

Applejack: Seriously. come on y'all, let's start making some memories.

Applejack: About the only girl at this school You can trust less than sunset shimmer Is rainbow dash.

Spike: Perhaps the three tribes could finally settle their differences.

Discord: Check check, check! is this thing on?

Celestia: But you need to learn to tame these abilities Through focused study.

Applejack: A deal's a deal.

Fluttershy: Mm hm.

Applejack: What? Kelp?

Luna: Let me get this straight.

Fluttershy: on the way here. And about the kirin being silent. and right now.

Tirek: It's impossible for any other creature to control.

Diamond Tiara: Hey, can you hear me?

Twilight Sparkle: The pony who holds my fate in her hooves.

Starlight: Wait to do a different friendship lesson when we get back.

Granny Smith: the first category is literary figures!

Rarity: Oh, your first grand galloping gala!

Starlight: I told twilight i'd run her school right.

Apple Bloom: Stop it.

Scootaloo: Nailed it.

Pinkie Pie: Ooh! ooh! tell me all about it.

Twilight Sparkle: This afternoon at three o'clock.

Flim: Congratulations, granny smith.

Rainbow Dash: Sorry!

Apple Bloom: E!

Yona: So rockhoof belongs.

Twilight Sparkle: How could trixie know such advanced magic?

Spike: So, what'd you find out?

Spike: Ah, it was nothing.

Apple Bloom: would it be ok If i enrolled in this dance class?

Scootaloo: there isn't another train to shirelanka for a month.

Fluttershy: Well, it's a game about who can be quiet the longest.

Discord: A guys night?

Pinkie Pie: some pony could come barrelling through That door at this very moment and become your best friend.

Twilight Sparkle: Oh! um thanks.

Twilight Sparkle: but i didn't know what else to do.

Twilight Sparkle: I have a copy of his treaties on ponies you know.

Rarity: Please let me go.

Twilight Sparkle: That means doing everything we can To make this place feel like yakyakistan.

Twilight Sparkle: But i can't figure it out!

Spike: Wait a minute.

Starlight: And our lives are so much better for it.

Rainbow Dash: Well then your book must be wrong!

Rainbow Dash: Don't leave me hanging!

Sugar Belle: No, three.

Spike: Wh-what happened?

Trixie: trixie keeps her promises!

Fluttershy: Um, excuse me, mister vampire bat?

Twilight Sparkle: we'll make sure things stay the same.

Rainbow Dash: come on, that goal you scored for the other team Was amazing!

Applejack: Oh yeah, about what?

Apple Bloom: Besides, she's only here a couple of weeks.

Pinkie Pie: I suppose being trapped for all time with a super duper bad guy In limbo might be ok if you were doing the limbo.

Fluttershy: Feathers.

Applejack: Alright, y'all.

Rainbow Dash: We've gotta go help!

Rainbow Dash: To figure out what your sporty side is.

Applejack: Just lay down, keep still, And promise me you won't say anything for once in your life.

Rainbow Dash: Being a Wonderbolt isn't just about showing off. It's also a responsibility.

Rainbow Dash: Just a little more, qualified.

Rarity: I beg your pardon?

Pinkie Pie: Okay, everypony. follow my lead.

Spike: there's got to be somewhere else we can take the eggs.

Spike: I guess I better get back upstairs and clean the library.

Rarity: There are crystal ponies!?

Star Swirl: we did what we had to do.

Fluttershy: Maybe there's somepony we can ask.

Applejack: It's a re-enactment of the founding of equestria.

Twilight Sparkle: What are you doing? you have to finish your race!

Twilight Sparkle: We've got to find the reference guide to the Elements of Harmony.

Twilight Sparkle: Applejack? what is going on?

Pinkie Pie: I'm! not! letting! go! i'm! responsible!

Scootaloo: Yes!

Rarity: First impressions count a great deal you know.

Granny Smith: Sure is.

Twilight Sparkle: I can't believe i'm going to meet starswirl the bearded.

Pinkie Pie: but now i have no psssd present for my sister at all!

Starlight: Yes but, that's just doesn't seem right.

Pinkie Pie: Why would applejack take some poor kitty's pj's, that's not very sporting of her.

Fluttershy: Good with animals, good with kids.

Twilight Sparkle: maybe, unless you'd consider taking care of sombra for us?

Starlight: I'm just barely keeping it together, And it would be wonderful if you two could actually try to help, Instead of bickering like foals.

Pinkie Pie: I'm going to miss you so much!

Ember: I don't want to talk about it.

Twilight Sparkle: I guess i hoped we'd get here and the mystery would just Magically be explained.

Pinkie Pie: Now, a little leftish while staying rightly.

Rarity: And please find something to do That doesn't create a large mess for me to clean up.

Discord: Everypony is always asking you to move a couch or help with a proposal.

Fluttershy: Too bad it's not a snow day.

Twilight Sparkle: I'm really sorry to bother you.

Apple Bloom: Of course not!

Chrysalis: I'm a pathetic pony princess!

Fluttershy: You! Just who do you think you are, Going around turning others into stone!?

Sweetie Belle: I'll bet she grows up to be a celebrity stylist.

Twilight Sparkle: I wasn't a natural at friendship.

Pinkie Pie: I am so close to breaking my personal cupcake icing record!

Discord: I can do whatever i want, whenever i want.

Rainbow Dash: I'm doing great thanks!

Big Macintosh: Spike?

Rarity: Steal everyponys' things, terrorize the town, And use me as a weapon against me own friends!

Yona: griffon mess up decorations?

Zecora: For your cutie mark, you will have to wait.

Trixie: no, of course not.

Rainbow Dash: All right!

Twilight Sparkle: Aww, how cute.

Scootaloo: They're drinking it, They're drinking it!

Spike: You sure you don't need any help?

Rarity: Oh! thank you so much!

Twilight Sparkle: but I'm still just your teacher.

Spike: Ow! i mean, how nice is this day?

Discord: Well, it's decent chaos, i don't know if i'd call it total.

Twilight Sparkle: What's this?

Apple Bloom: The answer to all our problems!

Twilight Sparkle: I'll decide who gets it, thank you very much.

Apple Bloom: Yeah, sugar belle's already picked her special somepony.

Applejack: Uh, rainbow dash, we're supposed to be acting like nothing's wrong.

Fluttershy: It's working!

Applejack: just remember, no talking About ponyville.

Rainbow Dash: Uh, thanks?

Twilight Sparkle: The thing you hate is being scared.

Rarity: Of course, there were fashion hits, and misses. Just look at those dreadful bell-bottoms. What were ponies thinking?

Rainbow Dash: Weather for the coronation is.

Fluttershy: Oh, rarity. you don't have to do that.

Twilight Sparkle: Except for the legend on this ancient shield.

Starlight: But you can't dwell on that now.

Sweetie Belle: But, maybe we could just try to do different things together?

Applejack: Fluttershy?

Starlight: Oh. got it.

Twilight Sparkle: I know you didn't like me going over there, But i just couldn't wait!

Fluttershy: um, I can do that, i think.

Twilight Sparkle: I'm finally gonna get to spend some quality time with my sister in law.

Rarity: And ponies treat me like the sad, invisible pony i've become.

Sandbar: Guys?

Rarity: Hmm, i do enjoy the wind swept look, But other ponies might need to see it before they feel it.

Scootaloo: I'll do whatever you want, Rainbow Dash!

Twilight Sparkle: Oh no!

Sunset Shimmer: You're lucky she was able to pull this off.

Rainbow Dash: Uh oh.

Fluttershy: And don't forget, Now you'll get seeds that will grow into even bigger and better apple trees.

Fluttershy: i was hoping you could help, if you're not too busy cheering up smolder's brother.

Spike: Another reason why i shouldn't compete.

Rainbow Dash: oh! i almost forgot.

Starlight: Okay. uh, it seemed more efficient to start with the scrapbooking so we could just get it out of the.

Trixie: Trade it? heavens no!

Discord: Don't be such a drama dragon. I've precipitated liquid cocoa on Equestria.

Applejack: We're from equestria, And we're plum tickered to meet y'all.

Apple Bloom: Heck, you'll do a whole obstacle course In high heels if you think it'll get me somethin' i want.

Apple Bloom: If we don't fix this, oh No, miss cheerilee won't be Able to teach.

Twilight Sparkle: Wow, great! I've never been to the gala. have you spike?

Rainbow Dash: you're not as annoying as i thought.

Thorax: I'm trying to start some new activities since the only thing We did before was hunt and patrol.

Apple Bloom: Oh, heh heh, yeah.

Spike: Exploits.

Pinkie Pie: oh Right, sorry! I haven't even read it yet. I was just looking at how pretty the paper is.

Applejack: Nah.

Silverstream: it's impressionism!

Thorax: Well you certainly don't act like it.

Apple Bloom: Ooh, can i call you grandpere pear?

Sweetie Belle: We booby trapped the float.

Rainbow Dash: Would you say she's just as awesome as me?

Rarity: Easier said than done.

Scootaloo: Ah!

Apple Bloom: And by tomorrow?

Twilight Sparkle: No problem, happy to do it!

Tirek: if we can figure out how to use it.

Trixie: I'm fresh out of smoke bombs.

Twilight Sparkle: rarity, what's going on?

Twilight Sparkle: it's a good thing too.

Starlight: I appreciate the history lesson dad, But i need to find the problem now.

Rainbow Dash: uh, see you two later, have fun!

Twilight Sparkle: Like a big scary bear.

Twilight Sparkle: Last time i was here, i had to use magic to get in.

Spike: Are you saying it's real?

Pinkie Pie: The map!

Twilight Sparkle: each one of you taught me something about friendship.

Twilight Sparkle: she's stolen my crown!

Discord: Twists and turns are my master plan.

Rainbow Dash: what's that supposed to mean!?

Sunburst: Right.

Spike: this is the school library!

Fluttershy: A friend who made us all feel beautiful In her lovely creations.

Fluttershy: I don't love it. this is not going to work at all!

Applejack: And we made good time today.

Rainbow Dash: Never know where enemies might be lurking.

Twilight Sparkle: You all go look for Spur. Fluttershy and I will do our best to keep everypony here safe.

Chrysalis: You just can't accept that you were beaten before you even realized there was a fight, can you?

Granny Smith: You should oughta tell a pony before you go a poofing 'em Around a stage!

Scootaloo: Yeah, you can't force us to keep gossiping.

Starlight: We're all quite fond of it.

Applejack: basically, losing steam makes you use more towels.

Smolder: Except maybe stand on stage.

Shining Armor: Your old foalsitter.

Sweetie Belle: he did.

Pinkie Pie: It's gonna be funna fun fun!

Applejack: well we'd better figure out something quick.

Twilight Sparkle: Let's get this over with.

Fluttershy: The ones that haven't fallen out yet From all her coughing, i mean.

Rainbow Dash: one question.

Rainbow Dash: Maybe.

Cozy Glow: She left me in charge.

Rarity: Oh, yeah, sure.

Twilight Sparkle: Anybody seen sunset shimmer?

Spike: did they mean her favorite thing to decorate a room with?

Zephyr: Ugh! i can't do this. i can't do anything.

Twilight Sparkle: Rainbow dash, you and the other pegasi spread out over equestria.

Rarity: how did you, how did you do that?

Scootaloo: We still have twenty five minutes.

Twilight Sparkle: I am not taking no for an answer.

Spike: Those are my girls! woo hoo!

Fluttershy: That's okay.

Rainbow Dash: Yeah, you should have warned me that you were bringing my parents.

Spike: We've all been called to an emergency meeting in canterlot!

Cozy Glow: And as headmare of the school of friendship.

Rarity: It sounds lovely darling.

Sweetie Belle: me three!

Sweetie Belle: And we're glad to have you!

Cadance: We're not exactly art enthusiasts But we could really use a night out.

Sweetie Belle: So, we did the whole competition together?

Rainbow Dash: They could be anywhere!

Applejack: Pretty sure she's gonna take offense to that.

Applejack: We did it!

Rarity: Half of them are traps!

Pinkie Pie: oh that. yeah. it's just all of you have found your thing.

Apple Bloom: I'm sure this job is real important But, i don't think i wanna call bugs for the rest of my life.

Discord: Oh, you must be rainbow dash, famed for her loyalty, The element of harmony you represent.

Spitfire: Well, la dee doodle da!

Twilight Sparkle: Pinkie, i need your pinkie sense to tell me what the impending Disaster is that future twilight was trying to warn me about!

Fluttershy: Oh! you were called, too!

Spike: Seriously, all of them.

Applejack: I don't need nothin' fancy.

Discord: Of ogres and oubliettes, did you not?

Cozy Glow: Good! Now we were talking about Grogar's Bell.

Zephyr: I kinda thought there'd be more ponies here.

Pinkie Pie: Screaming is fun.

Pinkie Pie: Commander Easyglider was the real cream of the crop, For with her wicked moves, the Wonderbolts Soared to the top.

Rarity: That's it!

Pinkie Pie: Fluttershy huh?

Starlight: Girls! i found two ponies who have something I think you should hear.

Applejack: I just wanted to say something real quick.

Rarity: Applejack saved spike's life and now he has to serve her forever.

Sunburst: Did you see this palominian letter opener?

Apple Bloom: No problem! just wanted to make Sure you heard About our cutie mark day camp.

Trixie: Now what?

Pinkie Pie: Hey, hey!

Spike: You feeling ok?

Apple Bloom: I mean, i know you like to win an' all but.

Chrysalis: We must retrieve the elements of harmony!

Rainbow Dash: But when you didn't show i had to do it all by myself!

Pinkie Pie: Well, it all started when.

Pinkie Pie: Hurry Hurry Hurry Hurry Hurry!

Mrs. Cake: oh Well what a lovely surprise.

Granny Smith: Oh dear. What is it?

Cadance: For dinner, not to babysit.

Rainbow Dash: Applejack, what the hay is going on!?

Rainbow Dash: Look, i'll be with you the whole night.

Chrysalis: This should be fun.

Fluttershy: I promised angel we'd go on a Picnic.

Spike: It's a fire ruby!

Fluttershy: Are you okay?

Rainbow Dash: He woulda' had fun here.

Twilight Sparkle: you can't trust flim and flam!

Fluttershy: Um, i'm just guessing but, is it zap apples?

Mayor Mare: these three ponies share a rare ability, to help others find their true purpose.

Pinkie Pie: Maybe not forever, though.

Rainbow Dash: I've got it!

Smolder: Huh?

Twilight Sparkle: All right, all right!

Spike: Right?

Pinkie Pie: Okie dokie.

Fluttershy: But, i can't let angel starve.

Iron Will: where princess cadance rescued her alicorn baby, spike.

Scootaloo: Oh uh, you know s-stuff.

Pinkie Pie: And then i said, oatmeal? are you craz.

Luna: Although it would be nice to get started.

Neighsay: Instead of gallivanting off on adventures beyond them.

Apple Bloom: You're sure you don't want me to stick around Till the end of the market?

Apple Bloom: We were so busy with that obstacle course, We didn't even get to talk!

Trixie: If you say so.

Scootaloo: this has to work!

Pinkie Pie: And hide and seek!

Sunset Shimmer: Dear Princess Twilight.

Fluttershy: why?

Fluttershy: Oh, um, whatever you think is best.

Twilight Sparkle: I'm sure that won't happen.

Applejack: i've been doing farm work my whole life, and i'm not sure it's something you can just, figure out.

Twilight Sparkle: Maybe we should all do the same.

AK Yearling: There they are!

Rarity: Fluttershy, we must talk to you.

Apple Bloom: So you should do the choreography.

Rarity: You know with a little work I think i could make him look like a rabbit instead.

Spike: And, here comes the best part.

Discord: Ok fellas, this is a good start, but stand back.

Discord: You did.

Rainbow Dash: Well, i think we should leave asap.

Trixie: starlight glimmer!

Rarity: They were right here.

Celestia: Twilight, it doesn't matter if Discord set up your successes or not.

Rainbow Dash: Yep.

Zephyr: You don't have to come up with some excuse To hang out with me, rainbows.

Celestia: And use their power to defeat the queen.

Autumn Blaze: Would you excuse me?

Apple Bloom: But, you've done that, right?

Rarity: you know, the second part where i said pinkie pie had to give something up.

Autumn Blaze: Got it.

Quibble Pants: really not all that sporty.

Rainbow Dash: No more arguing.

Twilight Sparkle: What exactly does everypony do?

Twilight Sparkle: Except it was all a lie.

Rainbow Dash: That might help.

Rainbow Dash: What?

Fluttershy: Are you okay?

Rainbow Dash: Any questions?

Autumn Blaze: Oh! you want the cure for the stream of silence.

Sunset Shimmer: But let's let bygones be bygones.

Pinkie Pie: Oh, that makes more sense.

Starlight: Come back soon!

Fluttershy: I'm gonna take you all home with me And give you all hot cocoas.

Applejack: We're hiding from her.

Applejack: Twilight! There you are!

Rainbow Dash: It can't be!

Spike: Uh, intermission?

Twilight Sparkle: That's what silverstream meant by houses.

Pinkie Pie: Maybe.

Rainbow Dash: If fancy meant confusing.

Scootaloo: They're supposed to be on the train.

Twilight Sparkle: that's cerberus!

Scootaloo: I think I've seen her add sugar to that bowl six times so far.

Fluttershy: Everyone's so excited. But I can't imagine anypony's more excited than you. Moving to Canterlot.

Luna: But nights are long for me.

Star Swirl: He is here.

Applejack: Mighty kind of you to let us keep all these toys in your storage locker Sunset.

Rainbow Dash: Uh.

Sunset Shimmer: But, we didn't win!

Spike: What are you talking about? i'm a great princess.

Sweetie Belle: Or is it a ring? are you a jewelry maker?

Spike: We aren't even close to being even steven. Please applejack, you must allow me to assist you further!

Apple Bloom: Come on back tomorrow, Everypony.

Twilight Sparkle: That would be great.

Spike: Yeah.

Rarity: it's lucky for you applejack is too stubborn to relax.

Rainbow Dash: a bad one.

Spike: hey! up here!

Twilight Sparkle: Spike, could you send a scroll to princess luna?

Autumn Blaze: i wonder if that second half could make a difference.

Rarity: These all do magic.

Spike: Of course Big Mac asked me to help with his proposal.

Rainbow Dash: Agh!

Spike: I'm so sorry all this happened!

Sunset Shimmer: Yes. she's so very special.

Twilight Sparkle: All our problems are just little jokes it played on us.

Rainbow Dash: The, first rule?

Twilight Sparkle: How clever.

Rainbow Dash: Trust me.

Rainbow Dash: Fine by me! maybe i can spend some time doing something I actually like now!

Trixie: Yes, well, before we throw away the magical items it's taken me Years to collect, we could try switching hammocks.

Spike: Mistress marevelous!

Rainbow Dash: Yeah, don't you?

Applejack: shadows everywhere!

Twilight Sparkle: You're the one who doesn't get it, cozy.

Discord: Oh, you're talking about me, i presume.

Twilight Sparkle: You can tackle a friendship lesson today And we can review your progress When i get back later this evening.

Rarity: I'll never have something finished in time.

Shining Armor: That seems to be what is protecting it.

Spike: Sweet!

Pinkie Pie: i, i broke the pinkie party promise!

Twilight Sparkle: Accredited?

Twilight Sparkle: Princess celestia gifted these to our school.

Twilight Sparkle: But where?

Rainbow Dash: i'm pretty sure that wasn't what i signed up for.

Sweetie Belle: Come back! come back!

Luna: But perhaps you didn't have the whole story.

Fluttershy: I would just like to ask I mean, if it would be all right.

Trixie: What are friends for?

Discord: Yes you can, your finest tea set, please.

Fluttershy: I don't know what i'm going to do if i have to defend myself One, more, time.

Starlight: I didn't want to lose you as a friend.

Twilight Sparkle: Go!

Rarity: Hello?

Twilight Sparkle: And it's still open to the elements of harmony!

Sweetie Belle: Pro, it's beautiful.

Apple Bloom: Cause i'm not goin' anywhere.

Rarity: One more filly clown surprise please!

Fluttershy: This is good!

Discord: Oh, tree hugger, you're such a great friend.

Pinkie Pie: look, rarity, applejack lent me a harmonica!

Spike: I know.

Rainbow Dash: That's why i hired spike as my ghost writer.

Spike: Hold on.

Twilight Sparkle: Hello fluttershy.

Neighsay: Your headmare is right.

Spike: Hey fluttershy.

Chrysalis: Is what happens to those who turn their back on the hive!

Rarity: And pose!

Pinkie Pie: I knew she'd love it.

Rarity: I-i was just.

Pinkie Pie: oh, don't cry, little Friends. Look! look!

Twilight Sparkle: Maybe they should've stayed home!

Diamond Tiara: I knew you were worried for a second there, weren't you?

Discord: There is one last variable that we haven't accounted for.

Apple Bloom: magical curative tonic, my granny can do anything!

Spike: That was a close one.

Rarity: Please!

Rarity: then what are you suggesting?

Discord: Your friends laugh at you all the time.

Zecora: You were right to be concerned.

Applejack: That's what you're worried about? really?

Fluttershy: No worries rarity.

Cadance: why?

Pinkie Pie: Get it?

Applejack: What!? no!

Rarity: now i understand why you didn't come to the gem cave, having a friend in town is a rare treat.

Rarity: Happy!?

Luna: Somepony should investigate.

Starlight: ugh.

Fluttershy: please excuse me.

Spike: Now that the mystery's been solved, let's get out here huh?

Fluttershy: I hope not, I've had quite enough life threatening adventures Thank you very much.

Twilight Sparkle: How can there be two mes? It's not scientifically possible. You are not scientifically possible!

Rainbow Dash: It's too strong!

Rarity: If i can't convince him that i'm just as much of a farmhoof as applejack.

Starlight: I thought you said you could beat this thing!

Twilight Sparkle: That's just it Spike.

Applejack: Big mac! you can do anythin' in a dream remember?

Rarity: What in equestria is going on here?

Rarity: Oh, do they?

Pinkie Pie: Woo hoo!

Sunburst: Right.

Star Swirl: You must return us to limbo.

Twilight Sparkle: I know, i saw you coming and had to distract thorax By showing him chairs.

Applejack: Oh yeah? Well, I dare rarity to lighten up.

Autumn Blaze: That's what i said. Y'know, when i started talking again.

Twilight Sparkle: You want me to help protect an entire empire?

Spike: Whatever you're looking for, i hope you find it soon.

Twilight Sparkle: Starlight, i have something very important to discuss with you.

Sandbar: So why are you admitting this now?

Rainbow Dash: i got tickets to the Wonderbolts air show this Afternoon. Got to dash!

Zecora: No! No!

Twilight Sparkle: The metaphors make more sense when you're actually, Setting the table.

Discord: Well, that's some way to treat a suffering friend.

Apple Bloom: It's called poison joke.

Quibble Pants: I mean, there isn't a single thing after ring of destiny That is, even remotely in the realm of the possible.

Spike: I love hearth's warming eve.

Rarity: Although i do so wish that anything had turned out to be something else.

Scootaloo: you're making me pick between my family and my friends!

Twilight Sparkle: i thought everything was fine! what is going on!?

Twilight Sparkle: What was she trying to warn me about?

Pinkie Pie: Give her time.

Big Macintosh: Eyup.

Rainbow Dash: C'mon, ponies, let's make this happen!

Luna: i do!

Rainbow Dash: or the power ponies are comin' in!

Scootaloo: You just got to keep your head forward Until the very last minute, like this.

Starlight: Hey! uh, pinkie pie!

Pinkie Pie: C'mon, who doesn't want to hang, with geese!?

Applejack: They busted their rumps here.

Sweetie Belle: What is that thing?

Twilight Sparkle: It'd mean so much to the students if you were in our show.

Cadance: Fortunately, i have all the precise instructions right here.

Twilight Sparkle: What? that's not right.

Fluttershy: Aren't you excited to get all toasty and warm In your snuggly wuggly little beds?

Rainbow Dash: that is what you want, right?

Starlight: Sleeping in tight quarters bonding.

Rarity: Gum on their bum!

Rarity: I suppose you'll be eating me or something.

Apple Bloom: too bad nopony else wants to come out But, i'm glad we're doing this together.

Rainbow Dash: Uh, so, the pony of shadows was, really real?

Starlight: Kindly point them out.

Twilight Sparkle: No. That's not gonna work.

Pinkie Pie: except food.

Thorax: A changeling patrol!

Trixie: Oh no it, isn't that.

Silverstream: Ponies can turn into changelings?

Cozy Glow: Because, it's my fault!

Starlight: Ok. we'd better start moving if we want to make it To the crystal empire.

Applejack: Two apple fritters coming right up.

Twilight Sparkle: Like really big!

Rainbow Dash: Tell you what, it's almost time for freestyle training.

Twilight Sparkle: Stay calm, girls!

Apple Bloom: We were thinkin' of putting together A cutie mark summer camp.

Apple Bloom: Hey, girls!

Trixie: Teleportation spell go!

Twilight Sparkle: Trying to turn that apple into an orange!

Twilight Sparkle: i'm starting to think this whole operation might be a giant flop.

Rainbow Dash: Same sleek body. same flowing mane.

Spike: Um, twilight?

Rainbow Dash: Is it too, realistic for you?

Rarity: I heard that.

Pinkie Pie: Chimicherry, cherrychanga.

Sunset Shimmer: I didn't know there was another way.

Pinkie Pie: Who turned out the moon?

Scootaloo: All right, scootaloo.

Spike: Hey, who's gonna clean up this mess?

Twilight Sparkle: Here and in equestria.

Starlight: Add baking soda salt and cinnamon.

Twilight Sparkle: I just did.

Fluttershy: on the way here. And about the kirin being silent. and right now!

Sunset Shimmer: Must be why the other students say such awful things about you.

Fluttershy: Absolutely!

Twilight Sparkle: It worked! it worked!

Sunburst: foliation!

Rainbow Dash: somepony help!

Twilight Sparkle: I have to gain better control.

Twilight Sparkle: The spell has changed the elements of harmony!

Twilight Sparkle: Hyah!

Apple Bloom: Ha ha! talk about funny!

Ember: You're right! but what happened to the lava?

Rainbow Dash: Hey, who are you gonna listen to?

Applejack: Fluttershy, guess what!

Applejack: I hope you're happy.

Discord: Fine. call it a gentleman's wager.

Twilight Sparkle: Starlight, you have proved yourself to be a kind, Loyal strong honest, and truly magical friend.

Pinkie Pie: Pranks can be a lot of fun when everypony Has a good time.

Rainbow Dash: I didn't say that.

Rarity: you know what, pinkie pie? uh, maybe you could help me figure out what to order.

Cheerilee: We appreciate that you care About us and want us to be happy but.

Yona: black, green, red and blue. Red, black, hold one and two.

Zecora: Another sip of the potion will give you a peek.

Fluttershy: With the official bunny census.

Twilight Sparkle: Uh huh. or, you re enacted what you thought was fun.

Rainbow Dash: Hey, i never told that story to my students before.

Rainbow Dash: Duh! It was my idea to start the Rainbooms so we could be in the showcase.

Applejack: i know we've only got an hour but, i can't wait to have a steam.

Pinkie Pie: But it sounds like there's a ball and bucking, So i'm betting it's super duper fun.

Rarity: Your attitude is so feisty, it's fabulous!

Pinkie Pie: Let's not tell any pony that part where you maybe for sure Accidentally helped starlight enslave a town.

Spike: everypony, listen!

Rainbow Dash: Uh, thanks, everypony. it was really no big deal.

Spitfire: I've drummed flyers out of the bolts for less.

Gallus: How, did that, happen?

Cheerilee: Good question, sweetie belle, i like those reporters' instincts.

Twilight Sparkle: i got it! nopony can herd like applejack.

Rainbow Dash: You're not the first stubborn dragon we've met you know.

Starlight: it's just a little filly's story!

Twilight Sparkle: Which way are we supposed to go now?

Sassy Saddles: Sequins and sashes, rarity, they're exquisite!

Applejack: This whole mess is, kinda our fault.

Applejack: I think i'll come along and hunt 'em down.

Granny Smith: what kind of stone can be used to start a fire?

Rainbow Dash: Get, out!

Granny Smith: Well, I'll be.

Sweetie Belle: She was always fussing with her bangs and tail.

Luna: Hello! great news!

Starlight: You do?

Pinkie Pie: The mirror pool!

Luna: sometimes we can worry about a thing so much the fear can make us feel like we're trapped in a nightmare.

Zecora: Come with me.

Pinkie Pie: Yeah, I get that a lot.

Shining Armor: and get out, you'll be sibling supreme.

Starlight: I feel like that's almost good advice.

Rarity: Now hurry along!

Starlight: Gather round, friends, gather round!

Applejack: Well, it's a long story.

Scootaloo: And once he's in jail, we'll be competing! And then it's Cutie mark city!

Pinkie Pie: More balloons!

Trixie: But saddle arabia is much farther than my usual route.

AK Yearling: Now i'm getting blamed for things i didn't even do? Why would i steal from them?

Sweetie Belle: I thought we weren't going to wander off again?

Zecora: Tell me doctor, what should i do? I've never heard of swamp fever mind you.

Twilight Sparkle: The original wonderbolts lightning bolt insignia was.

Applejack: This time, it's actually yes.

Starlight: and the only pony who's really run the school of friendship is the princess of friendship.

Twilight Sparkle: Oh, what are we going to do?

Cozy Glow: Now, now, professor. We all know you're not the fast one.

Twilight Sparkle: Did you see what she.

Twilight Sparkle: There is?

Discord: Surprise! we won.

Fluttershy: Um.

Rainbow Dash: Mom, please! they don't want to hear about your bath time.

Applejack: Chatty mcgee must have skipped over that part.

Fluttershy: Oh no, i'm so sorry but, i seem to be out.

Rainbow Dash: Me neither.

Starlight: Can you come to twilight's class with me? i-it won't take long.

Discord: There you go, Back to normal, just the way you like it.

Spike: So, no creature is gonna want to be around me?

Twilight Sparkle: Just like how i left my friendships.

Tirek: i don't have to like it.

Twilight Sparkle: Gabby gums doesn't value anypony's privacy.

Fluttershy: Girls!

Twilight Sparkle: What if they become too ambitious?

Sweetie Belle: Flowers. don't forget the flowers.

Gallus: we kinda have a special connection with it after last year.

Sweetie Belle: Yeah, sure we can.

Fluttershy: It's working!

Fluttershy: Oh, how wonderful. Why don't you sing it with me?

Rainbow Dash: But they finished the race.

Pinkie Pie: Potatoes get mashed, and then evaporate into potato moisture where they converge into potato clouds.

Spike: So uh, big mac and i were wondering.

Cozy Glow: I didn't want to be friends anyway.

Apple Bloom: Well, us blankflanks have to meet somewhere!

Applejack: I think we ran off to the end of equestria Before we even knew what that map was!

Twilight Sparkle: You've guided me since i was a filly.

Pinkie Pie: Ooh, look!

Scootaloo: Her inspirational poster!

Pinkie Pie: The only thing that could possibly help me is a letter from rainbow dash!

Spike: you can't talk to her!

Twilight Sparkle: Look at them all!

Spike: Yeah. that's what it is.

Big Macintosh: eeyup!

Twilight Sparkle: The eye patch! another sign!

Twilight Sparkle: You just learn differently.

Pinkie Pie: And eventually kablam! we get friendship problem'd right between the eyes!

Applejack: we'll just have to do this another day.

Smolder: Gee, thanks.

Starlight: But i was wrong. a real leader doesn't force her subjects To deny who they are.

Scootaloo: Game on!

Pinkie Pie: Do you like my mystical orb of fate's destiny?

Applejack: Uh huh. if you say so.

Twilight Sparkle: Even with rainbow dash's replacement, i don't think we're gonna qualify.

Starlight: that seems a little extreme.

Rarity: Aah!

Twilight Sparkle: Well, the good news is we both got called by the map.

Fluttershy: I'm so sorry. i thought i'd have a beautiful sanctuary For you all to stay in by now.

Applejack: Plus it's been a tough harvest this year, What with all the blight.

Rarity: Oh it'll be a little bit of work, But it'll be a wonderful boost for my business.

Fluttershy: So i wasn't a vampire?

Sugar Belle: Oh big mac, thank you so much.

Pinkie Pie: But do you accept my apology?

Twilight Sparkle: Alright. dinner it is!

Twilight Sparkle: but a certain Star Swirl the Bearded wasn't having it.

Apple Bloom: No, but they're about to!

Spike: ya know, whenever i'm feeling a little down it, it always helps if i do something with a friend.

Spike: Uh, I'd love to stay, but got to go!

Twilight Sparkle: I just want to be there to see the look on pinkie's face when we find out, nothing's wrong.

Pinkie Pie: Good morning!

Smolder: spike's my friend, you mess with him, you mess with me.

Fluttershy: This is the first vampire fruit bat i've ever me and.

Twilight Sparkle: Run!

Rarity: I suppose that's true, And i do have a lot of work to do.

Sweetie Belle: So?

Rarity: you really can see everything from here.

Rainbow Dash: Is it because i took the last broccoli at the dinner and you really, really wanted it?

Twilight Sparkle: But, what if.

Starlight: yeah, about that.

Shining Armor: And so the games conclude as they always do,.

Spike: You know who.

Scootaloo: Well, don't even think about riding it, babs.

Autumn Blaze: are you hungry?

Rainbow Dash: I've only stood out for making mistakes.

Starlight: Not unless we solved a friendship problem every few Seconds, and i kinda hope this one will be it for a while.

Spike: Wow! you're really going all out to cheer up big mac.

Sunburst: Just to see if there were issues any of you had With your friends.

Apple Bloom: We take cash or credit.

Pinkie Pie: Rise and shine, rainbow dash! it's a brand new day, and we've got a lot of pranking to.

Pinkie Pie: Never mind. they're gone.

Rainbow Dash: Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh!

Smolder: scales sat with the dragon lord's family and friends, and had the biggest, best dinner of gemstones she'd ever eaten.

Rainbow Dash: Now, where's my book?

Spike: Dude, that's creepy.

Mayor Mare: And do you matilda, Take this donkey to be your lawfully wedded husband?

Rarity: what in equestria would we fight about?

Pinkie Pie: I do! your heart gets all racey!

Pinkie Pie: He just said, nice catch in frog.

Chrysalis: Almost there.

Rarity: Good grief! this isn't working.

Twilight Sparkle: Huh?

Fluttershy: um, as you can see we're, kind of at an impasse.

Rainbow Dash: And sky needs to be able to fly without you, or he won't make it.

Twilight Sparkle: Huh?

Fluttershy: Yes, but they had to go.

Pinkie Pie: So Rainbow Dash did it!

Twilight Sparkle: I can use this data to help advance friendships all over equestria!

Rarity: Well applejack?

Pinkie Pie: no more belly growl interruptions for team twipie!

Twilight Sparkle: But you have to believe me When i tell you that nightmare night, is one of the most popular celebrations we have.

Rarity: Oh! oh, sweetie.

Twilight Sparkle: I've even devised a better system for organizing them.

Rainbow Dash: Yesiree, just call me care mare.

Starlight: But it seems pretty clear that sunburst and i have grown apart.

Twilight Sparkle: But the opposite is true!

Rainbow Dash: Fluttershy's lessons are so small, you can barely read them.

Rainbow Dash: Help you with your unfinished novel?

Rarity: Oh, that's not mine.

Maud: Ok.

Starlight: translating Some ancient olde ponish text.

Rainbow Dash: Yeah, it's okay, but it's no cloudsdale mobile!

Rainbow Dash: but all of you do, and i care about you.

Pinkie Pie: Applejack cries on the inside, twilight!

Spitfire: Great!

Apple Bloom: Woo hoo!

Starlight: And octavia is worried the responsibilities of Vice headmare will take too much time away from her music.

Rarity: ah! oh that looks scary!

Celestia: Improvise!

Scootaloo: Hey! what are you doing here?

Big Macintosh: eeyup.

Twilight Sparkle: Who were you talking to?

Flam: Right this way, good sir!

Sweetie Belle: We better go see what's wrong.

Twilight Sparkle: Oh, that's just an old ponies' tale.

Pinkie Pie: Fine! I wasn't gonna pull out the Showstopper, but you're a lovely Audience, and i think you Deserve it!

Rarity: They were all leaving.

Fluttershy: Oh, poor opal. where is the sick darling?

Twilight Sparkle: Oh, okay!

Ocellus: Actually, i remember that too.

Cadance: Because, it's not your special day.

Applejack: Hold on, everypony.

Trixie: Many fans, you say?

Discord: You've got to show everypony that you're too cool to be bothered with so called love. observe.

Pinkie Pie: oh, i mean.

Scootaloo: And instead of forcing ourselves To do something that's not meant for us.

Twilight Sparkle: Proof!? You want proof!? Well I used these same study methods to study the history of the wonderbolts.

Applejack: No, you are!

Twilight Sparkle: There you are!

Granny Smith: It's beautiful.

Scootaloo: Weeks of planning has all come down to this. All we have to do now is wait for our chaperone to get here.

Gabby: I sure wish i could send scrolls with my breath!

Sweetie Belle: The derby was supposed to be for us, not the three of you!

Applejack: Well how are we gonna solve a friendship problem, If none of 'em will tell us what it is?

Twilight Sparkle: but I've never been more ready for anything in my life.

Pinkie Pie: Where'd you get it?

Starlight: Sorry about wasting bits on street food.

Starlight: A lot better now.

Twilight Sparkle: Oh, come on!

Discord: What?

Twilight Sparkle: We all did.

Mrs. Cake: That was the first of many cakes for me.

Apple Bloom: And got lost!

Pinkie Pie: I know! The pie is blueberry because wonderbolt outfits are blue. The crust is rainbow, for obvious reasons.

Fluttershy: I'm great. I'm a super famous fashion model. Why wouldn't I be great?

Apple Bloom: Oh. well, i guess that changes things.

Sweetie Belle: where are you going!?

Scootaloo: Something we forgot to add that both places have.

Rarity: Oh er, this is applejack.

Spike: The pegasi, the unicorns, and the earth ponies.

Chrysalis: oh no, this is perfect! we need a distraction and those ridiculous ponies just gave it to us! now, do exactly as i tell you.
